/// <summary>
/// The docker pause command suspends all processes in the specified containers. On Linux, this uses the freezer cgroup. Traditionally, when suspending a process the SIGSTOP signal is used, which is observable by the process being suspended. With the freezer cgroup the process is unaware, and unable to capture, that it is being suspended, and subsequently resumed. On Windows, only Hyper-V containers can be paused.
