    /// Delete resources by file names, stdin, resources and names, or by resources and label selector. JSON and YAML formats are accepted. Only one type of argument may be specified: file names, resources and names, or resources and label selector. Some resources, such as pods, support graceful deletion. These resources define a default period before they are forcibly terminated (the grace period) but you may override that value with the --grace-period flag, or pass --now to set a grace-period of 1. Because these resources often represent entities in the cluster, deletion may not be acknowledged immediately. If the node hosting a pod is down or cannot reach the API server, termination may take significantly longer than the grace period. To force delete a resource, you must specify the --force flag. Note: only a subset of resources support graceful deletion. In absence of the support, the --grace-period flag is ignored. IMPORTANT: Force deleting pods does not wait for confirmation that the pod's processes have been terminated, which can leave those processes running until the node detects the deletion and completes graceful deletion. If your processes use shared storage or talk to a remote API and depend on the name of the pod to identify themselves, force deleting those pods may result in multiple processes running on different machines using the same identification which may lead to data corruption or inconsistency. Only force delete pods when you are sure the pod is terminated, or if your application can tolerate multiple copies of the same pod running at once. Also, if you force delete pods, the scheduler may place new pods on those nodes before the node has released those resources and causing those pods to be evicted immediately. Note that the delete command does NOT do resource version checks, so if someone submits an update to a resource right when you submit a delete, their update will be lost along with the rest of the resource. After a CustomResourceDefinition is deleted, invalidation of discovery cache may take up to 6 hours. If you don't want to wait, you might want to run "kubectl api-resources" to refresh the discovery cache.

    /// Drain node in preparation for maintenance. The given node will be marked unschedulable to prevent new pods from arriving. 'drain' evicts the pods if the API server supports https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/ eviction https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/ . Otherwise, it will use normal DELETE to delete the pods. The 'drain' evicts or deletes all pods except mirror pods (which cannot be deleted through the API server).  If there are daemon set-managed pods, drain will not proceed without --ignore-daemonsets, and regardless it will not delete any daemon set-managed pods, because those pods would be immediately replaced by the daemon set controller, which ignores unschedulable markings.  If there are any pods that are neither mirror pods nor managed by a replication controller, replica set, daemon set, stateful set, or job, then drain will not delete any pods unless you use --force.  --force will also allow deletion to proceed if the managing resource of one or more pods is missing. 'drain' waits for graceful termination. You should not operate on the machine until the command completes. When you are ready to put the node back into service, use kubectl uncordon, which will make the node schedulable again.https://kubernetes.io/images/docs/kubectl_drain.svg Workflowhttps://kubernetes.io/images/docs/kubectl_drain.svg

It will open the editor defined by your KUBE_EDITOR, or EDITOR environment variables, or fall back to 'vi' for Linux or 'notepad' for Windows. You can edit multiple objects, although changes are applied one at a time. The command accepts file names as well as command-line arguments, although the files you point to must be previously saved versions of resources. Editing is done with the API version used to fetch the resource. To edit using a specific API version, fully-qualify the resource, version, and group. The default format is YAML. To edit in JSON, specify "-o json". The flag --windows-line-endings can be used to force Windows line endings, otherwise the default for your operating system will be used. In the event an error occurs while updating, a temporary file will be created on disk that contains your unapplied changes. The most common error when updating a resource is another editor changing the resource on the server. When this occurs, you will have to apply your changes to the newer version of the resource, or update your temporary saved copy to include the latest resource version.
