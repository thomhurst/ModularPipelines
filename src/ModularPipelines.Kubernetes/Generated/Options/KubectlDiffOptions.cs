/// Diff configurations specified by file name or stdin between the current online configuration, and the configuration as it would be if applied. The output is always YAML. KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF environment variable can be used to select your own diff command. Users can use external commands with params too, example: KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF="colordiff -N -u" By default, the "diff" command available in your path will be run with the "-u" (unified diff) and "-N" (treat absent files as empty) options. Exit status: 0 No differences were found. 1 Differences were found. &gt;1 Kubectl or diff failed with an error. Note: KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF, if used, is expected to follow that convention.
