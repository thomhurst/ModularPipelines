/// <summary>
/// Expose a resource as a new Kubernetes service. Looks up a deployment, service, replica set, replication controller or pod by name and uses the selector for that resource as the selector for a new service on the specified port. A deployment or replica set will be exposed as a service only if its selector is convertible to a selector that service supports, i.e. when the selector contains only the matchLabels component. Note that if no port is specified via --port and the exposed resource has multiple ports, all will be re-used by the new service. Also if no labels are specified, the new service will re-use the labels from the resource it exposes. Possible resources include (case insensitive): pod (po), service (svc), replicationcontroller (rc), deployment (deploy), replicaset (rs)
