    /// The class type of the Looker instance. CLASS_TYPE must be one of: p1,      r1.      Custom Domains - Looker (Google Cloud core) lets you serve your    application through a custom domain. If you use a custom domain, Google    will provide a managed auto-renewing SSL certificate for security.      DNS changes can take up to 24 hours to take effect. Your SSL certificate    will take several minutes to activate. Note that you must get the Type A    DNS Record from the Google Cloud Console and update with your domain    registrar for your custom domain to work properly.       --custom-domain=CUSTOM_DOMAIN       Domain name wanted to serve the Looker instance.

    /// This specifies whether public IP is enabled on the Looker instance.      User Allocations - There are ten Standard and two Developer users included    in the cost of the product. You can allocate additional Standard, Viewer,    and Developer users for this instance. It is an optional step and can be    modified later.      With the Standard edition of Looker (Google Cloud core), you can provision    up to 50 total users, distributed across Viewer, Standard, and Developer.       --add-developer-users=ADD_DEVELOPER_USERS       Number of additional Developer Users to allocate to the Looker       Instance.       --add-standard-users=ADD_STANDARD_USERS       Number of additional Standard Users to allocate to the Looker       Instance.       --add-viewer-users=ADD_VIEWER_USERS       Number of additional Viewer Users to allocate to the Looker Instance.      Private Service Connect - Private Service Connect allows the Looker    Instance to be reached via a private connection from inside a VPC network,    and for the Looker Instance to connect to managed services via private    connections.       At most one of these can be specified:        --clear-psc-allowed-vpcs        Remove all service attachments from the PSC config of the instance.        --psc-allowed-vpcs=[PSC_ALLOWED_VPCS,...]        List of VPCs that are allowed ingress into the Looker instance.       At most one of these can be specified:        --clear-psc-service-attachments        Remove all allowed VPCs from the PSC config of the instance.        --psc-service-attachment=[attachment=ATTACHMENT],[domain=DOMAIN],[multiple-domains=MULTIPLE-DOMAINS]        Service attachments representing egress connections for the Looker        instance. This flag can be repeated. (Example:        --psc-service-attachment        domain="mydomain.com",attachment="projects/my-project/regions/us-east1/serviceAttachments/sa"        --psc-service-attachments        domain="mydomain2.com",attachment="projects/my-project/regions/us-east1/serviceAttachments/sa2")          You can also assign multiple domains to a single service        attachment. (Example: --psc-service-attachment        multiple-domains="mydomain.com;mydomain2.com",attachment="projects/my-project/regions/us-east1/serviceAttachments/sa")      Deny Maintanence Period - You must allow at least 48 hours of maintenance    availability in a 60-day rolling window. Only contiguous availability    windows of at least two hours are considered. When setting a maintenance    exclusion please be aware that excluding application upgrades cannot    exceed 60-days and excluding infrastructure upgrades cannot exceed    90-days.       --deny-maintenance-period-end-date=DENY_MAINTENANCE_PERIOD_END_DATE       End date of the deny maintenance period in format: YYYY-MM-DD         This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in       this group are specified.       --deny-maintenance-period-start-date=DENY_MAINTENANCE_PERIOD_START_DATE       Start date of the deny maintenance period in format: YYYY-MM-DD         This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in       this group are specified.       --deny-maintenance-period-time=DENY_MAINTENANCE_PERIOD_TIME       Time in UTC when the period starts and ends. A valid time of day must       be specified in 24hr format (ex: 13:00, 17:30, 23:45).         This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in       this group are specified.      Controlled Egress - Controlled egress allows you to egress data from a    Looker (Google Cloud core) instance to a third party service provider.       --egress-enabled       This specifies whether controlled egress is enabled on the Looker       instance. To disable controlled egress, use the --no-egress-enabled       flag.       --egress-fqdns=[EGRESS_FQDNS,...]       List of FQDNs that are allowed to egress from the Looker instance.       Example: --egress-fqdns="github.com,my.salesforce.com". To clear all       egress FQDNs, use --egress-fqdns="".       --marketplace-enabled       This specifies whether marketplace is enabled for controlled egress       on the Looker instance. To disable marketplace for controlled egress,       use the --no-marketplace-enabled flag.      Maintenance Window - Maintenance typically only takes place once every few    months, and requires your instance to be restarted while updates are made,    which disrupts service briefly.       --maintenance-window-day=MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_DAY       Day of the week for the maintenance window, in UTC time zone.       MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_DAY must be one of: friday, monday, saturday,       sunday, thursday, tuesday, wednesday.         This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in       this group are specified.       --maintenance-window-time=MAINTENANCE_WINDOW_TIME       Hour of day for maintenance window, in UTC time zone. A valid time of       day must be specified in 24hr format (ex: 13:00, 17:30, 23:45).       Maintenance will be scheduled within 60 minutes. To set the       maintenance-window-time attribute:       + provide the argument --maintenance-window-time on the command        line.         This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in       this group are specified.      OAuth Application Credentials - Looker Instance OAuth login settings.    Setup an OAuth app that will allow users to authenticate and access the    instance. For more information see:    https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#creatingcred       --oauth-client-id=OAUTH_CLIENT_ID       The client ID from an external OAuth application.         This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in       this group are specified.       --oauth-client-secret=OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET       The client secret from an external OAuth application.         This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in       this group are specified.
