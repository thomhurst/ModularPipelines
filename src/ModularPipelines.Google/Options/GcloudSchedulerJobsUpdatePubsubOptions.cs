    /// Schedule on which the job will be executed.        As a general rule, execution n + 1 of a job will not begin until      execution n has finished. Cloud Scheduler will never allow two      simultaneously outstanding executions. For example, this implies that      if the n+1 execution is scheduled to run at 16:00 but the n execution      takes until 16:15, the n+1 execution will not start until 16:15. A      scheduled start time will be delayed if the previous execution has not      ended when its scheduled time occurs. Learn more about the cron job      format      (https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/configuring/cron-job-schedules).        If --retry-count &gt; 0 and a job attempt fails, the job will be tried a      total of --retry-count times, with exponential backoff, until the job      succeeds or the number of retries is exhausted. Note that the next      scheduled execution time might be skipped if the retries continue      through that time. For more information, see Retry jobs      (https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/configuring/retry-jobs).

    /// Name of the Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic to publish to when the job runs.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-attributes       Clear the field corresponding to --attributes.       --remove-attributes=[REMOVE_ATTRIBUTES,...]       Comma-separated list of attribute keys to remove with the form       "KEY1,KEY2".       --update-attributes=[KEY=VALUE,...]       Comma-separated list of attributes. Each attribute has the form       "NAME=VALUE". You can specify up to 100 attributes.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-max-backoff       Clear the field corresponding to --max-backoff.       --max-backoff=MAX_BACKOFF; default="3600s"       Maximum amount of time to wait before retrying a job after it fails.       For example, 60s. Default is 3600s (1 hour).      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-max-doublings       Clear the field corresponding to --max-doublings.       --max-doublings=MAX_DOUBLINGS; default=5       Maximum number of times that the interval between failed job retries       will be doubled before the increase becomes constant.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-max-retry-attempts       Clear the field corresponding to --max-retry-attempts.       --max-retry-attempts=MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS       Number of times to retry the request if it fails or times out. Must       be in range 0-5 inclusive. Default is 0.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-max-retry-duration       Clear the field corresponding to --max-retry-duration.       --max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION       Time limit for retrying a failed job, measured from when the job was       first run. If specified with --max-retry-attempts greater than 0, the       job will be retried until both limits are reached. Default is 0       seconds (which means unlimited); however, if --max-retry-attempts is       also 0, a job attempt won't be retried if it fails.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-min-backoff       Clear the field corresponding to --min-backoff.       --min-backoff=MIN_BACKOFF; default="5s"       Minimum amount of time to wait before retrying a job after it fails.       For example, 10s. Default is 5s.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-time-zone       Clear the field corresponding to --time-zone.       --time-zone=TIME_ZONE; default="Etc/UTC"       Specifies the time zone to be used in interpreting --schedule. The       value of this field must be a time zone name from the tz database       (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).         Note that some time zones include a provision for daylight savings       time. The rules for daylight saving time are determined by the chosen       time zone.         For UTC use the string "utc". Default is "utc".      Body of the message to publish to the given topic name. Information on    message formatting and size limits can be found at:    https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/publisher#publish      At most one of these can be specified:       --message-body=MESSAGE_BODY       Body of the message.       --message-body-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE       Path to a file containing the body of the message. Use a full or       relative path to a local file containing the value of message_body.
