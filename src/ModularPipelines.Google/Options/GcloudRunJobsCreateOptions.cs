Only certain values are supported for type. Depending on the      provided type, other keys will be required. The following types are      supported with the specified additional keys:        cloud-storage: A volume representing a Cloud Storage bucket. This      volume type is mounted using Cloud Storage FUSE. See      https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gcs-fuse for the details and      limitations of this filesystem. Additional keys:      * bucket: (required) the name of the bucket to use as the source of       this volume      * readonly: (optional) A boolean. If true, this volume will be       read-only from all mounts.      * mount-options: (optional) A list of flags to pass to GCSFuse. Flags       should be specified without leading dashes and separated by       semicolons.        in-memory: An ephemeral volume that stores data in the instance's      memory. With this type of volume, data is not shared between instances      and all data will be lost when the instance it is on is terminated.      Additional keys:      * size-limit: (optional) A quantity representing the maximum amount       of memory allocated to this volume, such as "512Mi" or "3G". Data       stored in an in-memory volume consumes the memory allocation of the       container that wrote the data. If size-limit is not specified, the       maximum size will be half the total memory limit of all containers.        nfs: Represents a volume backed by an NFS server. Additional keys:      * location: (required) The location of the NFS Server, in the form       SERVER:/PATH      * readonly: (optional) A boolean. If true, this volume will be       read-only from all mounts.

    /// Removes volumes from the Cloud Run resource.      Container Flags        If the --container is specified the following arguments may only be specified after a --container flag.        --add-volume-mount=[volume=NAME,mount-path=MOUNT_PATH,...]        Adds a mount to the current container. Must contain the keys        volume=NAME and mount-path=/PATH where NAME is the name of a volume        on this resource and PATH is the path within the container's        filesystem to mount this volume.        --args=[ARG,...]        Comma-separated arguments passed to the command run by the        container image. If not specified and no '--command' is provided,        the container image's default Cmd is used. Otherwise, if not        specified, no arguments are passed. To reset this field to its        default, pass an empty string.        --clear-volume-mounts        Remove all existing mounts from the current container.        --command=[COMMAND,...]        Entrypoint for the container image. If not specified, the container        image's default Entrypoint is run. To reset this field to its        default, pass an empty string.        --cpu=CPU        Set a CPU limit in Kubernetes cpu units.          Cloud Run supports values fractional values below 1, 1, 2, 4, and        8. Some CPU values requires a minimum Memory --memory value.        --depends-on=[CONTAINER,...]        List of container dependencies to add to the current container.        --gpu=GPU        Cloud Run supports values 0 or 1. 1 gpu also requires a minimum 4        --cpu value and a minimum 16Gi --memory value.        --image=IMAGE        Name of the container image to deploy (e.g.        us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/job:latest).        --memory=MEMORY        Set a memory limit. Ex: 1024Mi, 4Gi.        --remove-volume-mount=[MOUNT_PATH,...]        Removes the volume mounted at the specified path from the current        container.        --startup-probe=[KEY=VALUE,...]        Comma separated settings for startup probe in the form KEY=VALUE.        Each key stands for a field of the probe described in        https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/rest/v1/Container#Probe.        Currently supported keys are: initialDelaySeconds, timeoutSeconds,        periodSeconds, failureThreshold, httpGet.port, httpGet.path,        grpc.port, grpc.service, tcpSocket.port.          For example, to set a probe with 10s timeout and HTTP probe        requests sent to 8080 port of the container:            $ --startup-probe=timeoutSeconds=10,httpGet.port=8080          To remove existing probe:            $ --startup-probe=""        At most one of these can be specified:         --clear-env-vars         Remove all environment variables.         --env-vars-file=FILE_PATH         Path to a local YAML or ENV file with definitions for all         environment variables. All existing environment variables will be         removed before the new environment variables are added. Example         YAML content:             KEY_1: "value1"           KEY_2: "value 2"           Example ENV content:             KEY_1="value1"           KEY_2="value 2"         --set-env-vars=[KEY=VALUE,...]         List of key-value pairs to set as environment variables. All         existing environment variables will be removed first.         Only --update-env-vars and --remove-env-vars can be used together.       If both are specified, --remove-env-vars will be applied first.          --remove-env-vars=[KEY,...]          List of environment variables to be removed.          --update-env-vars=[KEY=VALUE,...]          List of key-value pairs to set as environment variables.        Specify secrets to mount or provide as environment variables. Keys      starting with a forward slash '/' are mount paths. All other keys      correspond to environment variables. Values should be in the form      SECRET_NAME:SECRET_VERSION. For example:      '--update-secrets=/secrets/api/key=mysecret:latest,ENV=othersecret:1'      will mount a volume at '/secrets/api' containing a file 'key' with the      latest version of secret 'mysecret'. An environment variable named ENV      will also be created whose value is version 1 of secret 'othersecret'.        At most one of these can be specified:         --clear-secrets         Remove all secrets.         --set-secrets=[KEY=VALUE,...]         List of key-value pairs to set as secrets. All existing secrets         will be removed first.         Only --update-secrets and --remove-secrets can be used together. If       both are specified, --remove-secrets will be applied first.          --remove-secrets=[KEY,...]          List of secrets to be removed.          --update-secrets=[KEY=VALUE,...]          List of key-value pairs to set as secrets.      At most one of these can be specified:       --async       Return immediately, without waiting for the operation in progress to       complete.       --async cannot be used if executing the job after the update.        --execute-now        Execute the job immediately after the creation or update completes.        gcloud exits once the job has started unless the --wait flag is        set.        --wait        Wait until the execution has completed running before exiting. If        not set, gcloud exits successfully when the execution has started.        Implies --execute-now.      Direct VPC egress setting flags group.       --network=NETWORK       The VPC network that the Cloud Run job will be able to send traffic       to. If --subnet is also specified, subnet must be a subnetwork of the       network specified by this --network flag. To clear existing VPC       network settings, use --clear-network.       --network-tags=[TAG,...]       Applies the given network tags (comma separated) to the Cloud Run       job. To clear existing tags, use --clear-network-tags.       --subnet=SUBNET       The VPC subnetwork that the Cloud Run job will get IPs from. The       subnetwork must be /26 or larger. If --network is also specified,       subnet must be a subnetwork of the network specified by the --network       flag. If --network is not specified, network will be looked up from       this subnetwork. To clear existing VPC network settings, use       --clear-network.
