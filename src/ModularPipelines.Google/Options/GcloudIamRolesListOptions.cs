    /// Show deleted roles by specifying this flag.      At most one of these can be specified:       --organization=ORGANIZATION       Organization of the role you want to list.       --project=PROJECT_ID       Project of the role you want to list.         The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,       then the current project is assumed; the current project can be       listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can       be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.         --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in       the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate       on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,       and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,       use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.
