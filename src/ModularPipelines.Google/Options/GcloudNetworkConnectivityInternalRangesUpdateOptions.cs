At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-overlaps       Clear existing overlap fields for the range.       --overlaps=[OVERLAPS,...]       Overlap specifications for the range being updated. OVERLAPS must be       one of:         overlap-existing-subnet-range         Allows for creation of internal ranges that overlap with existing         subnets.         overlap-route-range         Allows for creation or existence of routes that have a more         specific destination than the created range.      At most one of these can be specified:       --ip-cidr-range=IP_CIDR_RANGE       IP range that this internal range defines.       --prefix-length=PREFIX_LENGTH       An alternative to ip-cidr-range. Can be set when trying to create a       reservation that automatically finds a free range of the given size.
