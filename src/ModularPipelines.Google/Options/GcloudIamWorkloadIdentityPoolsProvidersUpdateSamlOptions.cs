    /// A Common Expression Language (https://opensource.google/projects/cel)      expression, in plain text, to restrict what otherwise valid      authentication credentials issued by the provider should not be      accepted.        The expression must output a boolean representing whether to allow the      federation.        The following keywords may be referenced in the expressions:        * assertion: JSON representing the authentication credential issued       by the provider.      * google: The Google attributes mapped from the assertion in the       attribute_mappings.      * attribute: The custom attributes mapped from the assertion in the       attribute_mappings.        The maximum length of the attribute condition expression is 4096      characters. If unspecified, all valid authentication credential are      accepted.        The following example shows how to only allow credentials with a mapped      google.groups value of admins:          "'admins' in google.groups"

    /// Maps attributes from authentication credentials issued by an external      identity provider to Google Cloud attributes, such as subject and      segment.        Each key must be a string specifying the Google Cloud IAM attribute to      map to.        The following keys are supported:        * google.subject: The principal IAM is authenticating. You can       reference this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject that       appears in Cloud Logging logs. Cannot exceed 127 bytes.        * google.groups: Groups the external identity belongs to. You can       grant groups access to resources using an IAM principalSet binding;       access applies to all members of the group.        You can also provide custom attributes by specifying      attribute.{custom_attribute}, where {custom_attribute} is the name of      the custom attribute to be mapped. You can define a maximum of 50      custom attributes. The maximum length of a mapped attribute key is 100      characters, and the key may only contain the characters [a-z_0-9].        You can reference these attributes in IAM policies to define      fine-grained access for a workload to Google Cloud resources. For      example:        * google.subject:       principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/subject/{value}        * google.groups:       principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/group/{value}        * attribute.{custom_attribute}:       principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{location}/workloadIdentityPools/{pool}/attribute.{custom_attribute}/{value}        Each value must be a Common Expression Language      (https://opensource.google/projects/cel) function that maps an identity      provider credential to the normalized attribute specified by the      corresponding map key.        You can use the assertion keyword in the expression to access a JSON      representation of the authentication credential issued by the provider.        The maximum length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048      characters. When evaluated, the total size of all mapped attributes      must not exceed 8KB.        For AWS providers, the following rules apply:        * If no attribute mapping is defined, the following default mapping       applies:          {         "google.subject":"assertion.arn",         "attribute.aws_role":           "assertion.arn.contains('assumed-role')"           " ? assertion.arn.extract('{account_arn}assumed-role/')"           "  + 'assumed-role/'"           "  + assertion.arn.extract('assumed-role/{role_name}/')"           " : assertion.arn",        }        * If any custom attribute mappings are defined, they must include a       mapping to the google.subject attribute.        For OIDC providers, the following rules apply:        * Custom attribute mappings must be defined, and must include a       mapping to the google.subject attribute. For example, the following       maps the sub claim of the incoming credential to the subject       attribute on a Google token.          {"google.subject": "assertion.sub"}
