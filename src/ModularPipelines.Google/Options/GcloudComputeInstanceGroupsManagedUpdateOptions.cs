SHAPE must be one of:      any       The group picks zones for creating VM instances to fulfill the       requested number of VMs within present resource constraints and to       maximize utilization of unused zonal reservations. Recommended for       batch workloads that do not require high availability.     any-single-zone       The group schedules all instances within a single zone. The zone is       chosen based on hardware support, current resources availability,       and matching reservations. The group might not be able to create       the requested number of VMs in case of zonal resource availability       constraints. Recommended for workloads requiring extensive       communication between VMs.     balanced       The group prioritizes acquisition of resources, scheduling VMs in       zones where resources are available while distributing VMs as       evenly as possible across selected zones to minimize the impact of       zonal failure. Recommended for highly available serving or batch       workloads that do not require autoscaling.     even       The group schedules VM instance creation and deletion to achieve       and maintain an even number of managed instances across the       selected zones. The distribution is even when the number of managed       instances does not differ by more than 1 between any two zones.       Recommended for highly available serving workloads.    At most one of these can be specified:     --clear-autohealing      Clears all autohealing policy fields for the managed instance group.     --initial-delay=INITIAL_DELAY      Specifies the number of seconds that a new VM takes to initialize and      run its startup script. During a VM's initial delay period, the MIG      ignores unsuccessful health checks because the VM might be in the      startup process. This prevents the MIG from prematurely recreating a      VM. If the health check receives a healthy response during the      initial delay, it indicates that the startup process is complete and      the VM is ready. The value of initial delay must be between 0 and      3600 seconds. The default value is 0. See $ gcloud topic datetimes      for information on duration formats.     At most one of these can be specified:      --health-check=HEALTH_CHECK       Name of the health check to operate on.      --http-health-check=HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK       (DEPRECATED) HTTP health check object used for autohealing       instances in this group.       HttpHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.      --https-health-check=HTTPS_HEALTH_CHECK       (DEPRECATED) HTTPS health check object used for autohealing       instances in this group.       HttpsHealthCheck is deprecated. Use --health-check instead.    At most one of these can be specified:     --region=REGION      Region of the managed instance group to update. If not specified, you      might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).      A list of regions can be fetched by running:        $ gcloud compute regions list      Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command      invocation.     --zone=ZONE      Zone of the managed instance group to update. If not specified, you      might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).      A list of zones can be fetched by running:        $ gcloud compute zones list      Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command      invocation.    At most one of these can be specified:     --remove-workload-policy      Detaches the workload policy from the managed instance group.     --workload-policy=WORKLOAD_POLICY      Specifies the workload policy for the managed instance group. It can      be a full or partial URL to a resource policy containing the workload      policy.    Parameters for setting update policy for this managed instance group.     --update-policy-max-surge=MAX_SURGE      Maximum additional number of VMs that can be created during the      update process. This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage      of size to the managed instance group (e.g. 10%).     --update-policy-max-unavailable=MAX_UNAVAILABLE      Maximum number of VMs that can be unavailable during the update      process. This can be a fixed number (e.g. 5) or a percentage of size      to the managed instance group (e.g. 10%). Defaults to the number of      zones in which the managed instance group operates.     --update-policy-minimal-action=UPDATE_POLICY_MINIMAL_ACTION      Use this flag to minimize disruption as much as possible or to apply      a more disruptive action than is strictly necessary. The MIG performs      at least this action on each VM while updating. If the update      requires a more disruptive action than the one specified here, then      the more disruptive action is performed. UPDATE_POLICY_MINIMAL_ACTION      must be one of:       none        No action      refresh        Apply the new configuration without stopping VMs, if possible.        For example, use ``refresh`` to apply changes that only affect        metadata or additional disks.      restart        Apply the new configuration without replacing VMs, if possible.        For example, stopping VMs and starting them again is sufficient        to apply changes to machine type.      replace        Replace old VMs according to the        --update-policy-replacement-method flag.     --update-policy-most-disruptive-action=UPDATE_POLICY_MOST_DISRUPTIVE_ACTION      Use this flag to prevent an update if it requires more disruption      than you can afford. At most, the MIG performs the specified action      on each VM while updating. If the update requires a more disruptive      action than the one specified here, then the update fails and no      changes are made. UPDATE_POLICY_MOST_DISRUPTIVE_ACTION must be one      of:       none        No action      refresh        Apply the new configuration without stopping VMs, if possible.        For example, use ``refresh`` to apply changes that only affect        metadata or additional disks.      restart        Apply the new configuration without replacing VMs, if possible.        For example, stopping VMs and starting them again is sufficient        to apply changes to machine type.      replace        Replace old VMs according to the        --update-policy-replacement-method flag.     --update-policy-replacement-method=UPDATE_POLICY_REPLACEMENT_METHOD      Type of replacement method. Specifies what action will be taken to      update VMs. UPDATE_POLICY_REPLACEMENT_METHOD must be one of:       recreate        Recreate VMs and preserve the VM names. The VM IDs and creation        timestamps might change.      substitute        Delete old VMs and create VMs with new names.     --update-policy-type=UPDATE_TYPE      Specifies the type of update process. You can specify either      ``proactive`` so that the managed instance group proactively executes      actions in order to bring VMs to their target versions or      ``opportunistic`` so that no action is proactively executed but the      update will be performed as part of other actions. UPDATE_TYPE must      be one of:       opportunistic        Do not proactively replace VMs. Create new VMs and delete old        ones on resizes of the group and when you target specific VMs to        be updated or recreated.      proactive        Replace VMs proactively.
