    /// Force disablement. Bypasses any prompts for confirmation. When     disabling the entire feature, proceeds even if the feature is in use.     Might result in unexpected behavior.    At most one of these can be specified:     --fleet-default-member-config      Disable the fleet-default membership configuration      (https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/fleet-management/docs/manage-features).      Does not change existing membership configurations. Does nothing if      the feature is disabled.     Membership-specific flags. In the absence of --uninstall, using either    --memberships or --all-memberships removes the entire configuration for    the specified memberships, which unmanages and leaves existing Config    Sync installations on the membership clusters. Unmanagement does not    error if the feature is disabled.      --uninstall       Uninstall any previously-installed and managed Config Sync on the       specified memberships by setting the enabled field       (https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/enterprise/config-sync/docs/reference/gcloud-apply-fields)       to false. Clears all other configuration for each membership. Does       not wait for the uninstallation to complete. To bypass the       confirmation prompt, use --force. Requires the feature to be       enabled.       To uninstall Config Sync on select memberships, run:         $ gcloud container hub config-management disable --uninstall \           --memberships=example-membership-1,example-membership-2      At most one of these can be specified:       --all-memberships        All memberships in the fleet.       Membership resource - The group of arguments defining one or more      memberships. The arguments in this group can be used to specify the      attributes of this resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given      arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.       To set the project attribute:       ◇ provide the argument --memberships on the command line with a        fully specified name;       ◇ provide the argument --project on the command line;       ◇ set the property core/project.        --memberships=[MEMBERSHIPS,...]         IDs of the memberships or fully qualified identifiers for the         memberships.         To set the memberships attribute:         ▹ provide the argument --memberships on the command line.         This flag argument must be specified if any of the other         arguments in this group are specified.        --location=LOCATION         Location for the memberships.         To set the location attribute:         ▹ provide the argument --memberships on the command line with          a fully specified name;         ▹ provide the argument --location on the command line;         ▹ set the property gkehub/location.
