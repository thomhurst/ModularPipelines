To initiate authorization, enter the following command:          gcloud auth application-default login --no-browser        2. Copy the long command that begins with gcloud auth      application-default login --remote-bootstrap=".        3. Paste and run this command on the command line of a different,      trusted machine that has local installations of both a web browser and      the gcloud CLI tool version 372.0 or later.        4. Copy the long URL output from the machine with the web browser.        5. Paste the long URL back to the first machine under the prompt,      "Enter the output of the above command", and press Enter to complete      the authorization.        Enabled by default, use --no-browser to disable.

    /// By default, the project in billing/quota_project or core/project will      be written to application default credentials (ADC) as the quota      project. When both are set, billing/quota_project takes precedence. You      can use --billing-project to overwrite the value in      billing/quota_project. Similarly, you can use --project to overwrite      the value in core/project. Client libraries will send it to services      and use it for quota and billing. To be able to use a project as the      quota project, the account in ADC must have the      serviceusage.services.use permission on the project. This permission is      granted to the project editor and project owner. You can create custom      roles to include this permission.        Note that some cloud services may ignore this quota project and still      bill the project owning the resources.        In the following situations, you may use this flag to skip setting the      quota project:        * The account in ADC cannot be granted the project editor or owner       role or any role with the serviceusage.services.use permission.      * You always want to bill the project owning the resources.

If you want to authorize the client libraries on a machine that doesn't      have a browser and you cannot install the gcloud CLI on another machine      with a browser, use the --no-launch-browser flag. The      --no-launch-browser flag prevents the command from automatically      opening a web browser.        1. To initiate authorization, enter the following command:          gcloud auth application-default login --no-launch-browser        2. Copy the long URL that begins with      https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth...        3. Paste this URL into the browser of a different, trusted machine that      has a web browser.        4. Copy the authorization code from the machine with the web browser.        5. Paste the authorization code back to the first machine at the      prompt, "Enter authorization code", and press Enter to complete the      authorization.        Enabled by default, use --no-launch-browser to disable.
