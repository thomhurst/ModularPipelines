If empty, it     will search the IAM policies that are attached to all the searchable     asset types     (https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types).     Regular expressions are also supported. For example:     ◆ compute.googleapis.com.* snapshots IAM policies attached to asset      type starts with compute.googleapis.com.     ◆ .*Instance snapshots IAM policies attached to asset type ends with      Instance.     ◆ .*Instance.* snapshots IAM policies attached to asset type contains      Instance.     See RE2 (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) for all supported     regular expression syntax. If the regular expression does not match any     supported asset type, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned.

    /// Comma-separated list of fields specifying the sorting order of the     results. The default order is ascending. Add DESC after the field name     to indicate descending order. Redundant space characters are ignored.     Example: assetType DESC, resource. Only singular primitive fields in     the response are sortable:     ◆ resource     ◆ assetType     ◆ project     All the other fields such as repeated fields (e.g., folders) and     non-primitive fields (e.g., policy) are not supported.     Both --order-by and --sort-by flags can be used to sort the output,     with the following differences:     ◆ The --order-by flag performs server-side sorting (better      performance), while the --sort-by flag performs client-side sorting.     ◆ The --sort-by flag supports all the fields in the output, while the      --order-by flag only supports limited fields as shown above.

    /// Query statement. See how to construct a query     (https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/searching-iam-policies#how_to_construct_a_query)     for more information. If not specified or empty, it will search all the     IAM policies within the specified scope. Note that the query string is     compared against each Cloud IAM policy binding, including its     principals, roles, and Cloud IAM conditions. The returned Cloud IAM     policies will only contain the bindings that match your query. To learn     more about the IAM policy structure, see the IAM policy documentation     (https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/allow-policies/structure).     Examples:     ◆ policy:amy@gmail.com to find IAM policy bindings that specify user      amy@gmail.com.     ◆ policy:roles/compute.admin to find IAM policy bindings that specify      the Compute Admin role.     ◆ policy:comp* to find IAM policy bindings that contain comp as a      prefix of any word in the binding.     ◆ policy.role.permissions:storage.buckets.update to find IAM policy      bindings that specify a role containing the storage.buckets.update      permission. Note that if callers haven't been granted the      iam.roles.get permission for a role's included permissions, policy      bindings that specify this role will be dropped from the search      results.     ◆ policy.role.permissions:upd* to find IAM policy bindings that      specify a role containing upd as a prefix of any word in the role      permission. Note that if callers haven't been granted the      iam.roles.get permission for a role's included permissions, policy      bindings that specify this role will be dropped from the search      results.     ◆ resource:organizations/123456 to find IAM policy bindings that are      set on organizations/123456.     ◆ resource=//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/myproject      to find IAM policy bindings that are set on the project named      myproject.     ◆ Important to find IAM policy bindings that contain Important as a      word in any of the searchable fields (except for the included      permissions).     ◆ resource:(instance1 OR instance2) policy:amy to find IAM policy      bindings that are set on resources instance1 or instance2 and also      specify user amy.     ◆ roles:roles/compute.admin to find IAM policy bindings that specify      the Compute Admin role.     ◆ memberTypes:user to find IAM policy bindings that contain the user      principal type.
