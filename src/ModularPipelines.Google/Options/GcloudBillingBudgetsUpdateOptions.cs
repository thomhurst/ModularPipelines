Use 'BILLING_ACCOUNT' to allow only billing account-level users to have      full access to the budget.

At most one of these can be specified:       Calendar Period        --calendar-period=CALENDAR_PERIOD        Specified to track usage over recurring calendar period. If you're        creating a budget with a custom time period, omit this flag.        CALENDAR_PERIOD must be one of: calendar-period-unspecified, month,        quarter, year.       Custom Period        --start-date=START_DATE        Specified to track usage after any start date. This time period is        static, it does not recur.          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments        in this group are specified.        --end-date=END_DATE        Specified to track usage before any end date. This time period is        static, it does not recur. If specified, --start-date must also be        specified.      At most one of these can be specified:       --threshold-rules-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE       Import a file with the updated threshold rules. The threshold rules       in the file will replace the rules in the budget. This can be used to       add or remove specific threshold rules. Use a full or relative path       to a local file containing the value of threshold_rules.       --add-threshold-rule=[basis=BASIS],[percent=PERCENT]       Rule that triggers alerts (notifications of thresholds being crossed)       when spend exceeds the specified percentages of the budget. This flag       can be repeated to provide multiple thresholds above which an alert       is sent.         percent         Integer between 0 and 100 above which an alert is sent.         basis         Type of basis used to determine if spend has passed the         threshold. Must be one of: 'current-spend' or 'forecasted-spend'.         Behavior defaults to 'current-spend' if not set.       --clear-threshold-rules       Removes all threshold rules from the budget.
