If not specified, you might be      prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to      identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your      currently active project.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the      compute/zone property:          $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE        A list of zones can be fetched by running:          $ gcloud compute zones list        To unset the property, run:          $ gcloud config unset compute/zone        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable      CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.
