    /// TLS 1.3 Early Data ("0-RTT" or "zero round trip") allows clients to      include HTTP request data alongside a TLS handshake. This can improve      application performance, especially on networks where connection      interruptions may be common, such as on mobile. This applies to both      HTTP over TCP (ie: HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2) and HTTP/3 over QUIC.      TLS_EARLY_DATA must be one of:        DISABLED        TLS 1.3 Early Data is not advertised, and any (invalid) attempts to        send Early Data will be rejected.      PERMISSIVE        Enables TLS 1.3 Early Data for requests with safe HTTP methods        (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE). This mode does not enforce any other        limitations for requests with Early Data. The application owner        should validate that Early Data is acceptable for a given request        path.      STRICT        Enables TLS 1.3 Early Data for requests with safe HTTP methods, and        HTTP requests that do not have query parameters. Requests that send        Early Data containing non-idempotent HTTP methods or with query        parameters will be rejected with a HTTP 425.
