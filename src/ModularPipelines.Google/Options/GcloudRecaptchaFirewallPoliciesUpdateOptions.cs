A terminal action is any action      that forces a response, such as Allow, Block or Substitute. If it makes      sense for it to happen multple times, such as SetHeader, the action is      non-terminal.        Examples:      * Block and set the header with key foo to value bar       + --actions=block,set_header=foo=bar      * Substitute with path google.com and set two headers, one with key       key1 to value value1 and one with key key2 to value value2       + --actions=substitute=google.com,set_header=key1=value1,set_header=key2=value2
