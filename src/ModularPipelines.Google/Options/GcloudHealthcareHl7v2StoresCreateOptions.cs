    /// Immutable. Determines the version of both the default parser to be used      when schema      (https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.datasets.hl7V2Stores#ParserConfig.FIELDS.schema)      is not given, as well as the schematized parser used when schema      (https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.datasets.hl7V2Stores#ParserConfig.FIELDS.schema)      is specified. This field is immutable after HL7v2 store creation.      PARSER_VERSION must be one of:        v1        The parsedData includes every given non-empty message field except        the Field Separator (MSH-1) field. As a result, the parsed MSH        segment starts with the MSH-2 field and the field numbers are        off-by-one with respect to the HL7 standard.      v2        The parsedData includes every given non-empty message field.        v3        This version is the same as V2, with the following change. The        parsedData contains unescaped escaped field separators, component        separators, sub-component separators, repetition separators, escape        characters, and truncation characters. If schema        (https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.datasets.hl7V2Stores#ParserConfig.FIELDS.schema)        is specified, the schematized parser uses improved parsing        heuristics compared to previous versions.
