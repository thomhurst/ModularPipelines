    /// List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value      is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens      (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must      contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and      numbers.      At most one of these can be specified:       --add-ip-range-reservation=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]       Add a reservation of a range of IP addresses in the network.         start_address         The first address of this reservation block. Must be specified as         a single IPv4 address, e.g. 10.1.2.2.         end_address         The last address of this reservation block, inclusive. I.e., for         cases when reservations are only single addresses, end_address         and start_address will be the same. Must be specified as a single         IPv4 address, e.g. 10.1.2.2.         note         A note about this reservation, intended for human consumption.       --clear-ip-range-reservations       Removes all IP range reservations in the network.       --remove-ip-range-reservation=[PROPERTY=VALUE,...]       Remove a reservation of a range of IP addresses in the network.         start_address         The first address of the reservation block to remove.         end_address         The last address of the reservation block to remove.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-labels       Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then       --clear-labels is applied first.         For example, to remove all labels:           $ gcloud bms networks update --clear-labels         To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:           $ gcloud bms networks update --clear-labels \          --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]       List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is       silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then       --update-labels is applied first.
