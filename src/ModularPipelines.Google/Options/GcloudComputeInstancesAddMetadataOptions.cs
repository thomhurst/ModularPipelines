    /// Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on     the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an     equals sign. Each metadata key must be unique and have a max of 128     bytes in length. Each value must have a max of 256 KB in length.     Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g., --metadata     key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3. The combined total size for     all metadata entries is 512 KB.     In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, such as the     official images (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images), the     following metadata keys have special meanings:      startup-script       Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they       start running. For convenience, --metadata-from-file can be used to       pull the value from a file.      startup-script-url       Same as startup-script except that the script contents are pulled       from a publicly-accessible location on the web.       For startup scripts on Windows instances, the following metadata       keys have special meanings: windows-startup-script-url,       windows-startup-script-cmd, windows-startup-script-bat,       windows-startup-script-ps1, sysprep-specialize-script-url,       sysprep-specialize-script-cmd, sysprep-specialize-script-bat, and       sysprep-specialize-script-ps1. For more information, see Running       startup scripts       (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript).       At least one of [--metadata] or [--metadata-from-file] is required.

If not specified, you might be     prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to     identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your     currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud     prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform     zones.     To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the     compute/zone property:       $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE     A list of zones can be fetched by running:       $ gcloud compute zones list     To unset the property, run:       $ gcloud config unset compute/zone     Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable     CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.
