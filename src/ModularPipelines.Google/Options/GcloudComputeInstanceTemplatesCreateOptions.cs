At most one of these can be specified:       --node=NODE       The name of the node to schedule this instance on.       --node-affinity-file=PATH_TO_FILE       The JSON/YAML file containing the configuration of desired nodes onto       which this instance could be scheduled. These rules filter the nodes       according to their node affinity labels. A node's affinity labels       come from the node template of the group the node is in.         The file should contain a list of a JSON/YAML objects. For an       example, see       https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/nodes/provisioning-sole-tenant-vms#configure_node_affinity_labels.       The following list describes the fields:         key         Corresponds to the node affinity label keys of the Node resource.       operator         Specifies the node selection type. Must be one of: IN: Requires         Compute Engine to seek for matched nodes. NOT_IN: Requires         Compute Engine to avoid certain nodes.       values         Optional. A list of values which correspond to the node affinity         label values of the Node resource.           Use a full or relative path to a local file containing the value         of node_affinity_file.       --node-group=NODE_GROUP       The name of the node group to schedule this instance on.      Specifies the reservation for instances created from this template.       --reservation=RESERVATION       The name of the reservation, required when       --reservation-affinity=specific.       --reservation-affinity=RESERVATION_AFFINITY; default="any"       The type of reservation for instances created from this template.       RESERVATION_AFFINITY must be one of:         any         Consume any available, matching reservation.       none         Do not consume from any reserved capacity.       specific         Must consume from a specific reservation.      At most one of these can be specified:       --scopes=[SCOPE,...]       If not provided, the instance will be assigned the default scopes,       described below.

For example:            serving-ports="80;8080"          The service proxy will intercept inbound traffic, then forward it        to the specified serving port(s) on localhost.

If set to ON, the service proxy's control plane        generates a configuration that enables request ID-based tracing.        For more information, refer to the generate_request_id        documentation for the Envoy proxy. Allowed values are ON and OFF.        access-log        The filepath for access logs sent to the service proxy by the        control plane.
