If empty, it will     search all the searchable asset types     (https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types).     Regular expressions are also supported. For example:     ◆ compute.googleapis.com.* snapshots resources whose asset type      starts with compute.googleapis.com.     ◆ .*Instance snapshots resources whose asset type ends with Instance.     ◆ .*Instance.* snapshots resources whose asset type contains      Instance.     See RE2 (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) for all supported     regular expression syntax. If the regular expression does not match any     supported asset type, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned.

Redundant space characters are ignored.     Example: location DESC, name. Only singular primitive fields in the     response are sortable:     ◆ name     ◆ assetType     ◆ project     ◆ displayName     ◆ description     ◆ location     ◆ createTime     ◆ updateTime     ◆ state     ◆ parentFullResourceName     ◆ parentAssetType     All the other fields such as repeated fields (e.g., networkTags,     kmsKeys), map fields (e.g., labels) and struct fields (e.g.,     additionalAttributes) are not supported.     Both --order-by and --sort-by flags can be used to sort the output,     with the following differences:     ◆ The --order-by flag performs server-side sorting (better      performance), while the --sort-by flag performs client-side sorting.     ◆ The --sort-by flag supports all the fields in the output, while the      --order-by flag only supports limited fields as shown above.
