    /// Name to be displayed in the UI or developer portal to developers      registering for API access.      At most one of these can be specified:       --all-apis       Include all deployed API proxies in the product, so long as they       match the other parameters.       API proxies to which this API product is bound. Only those API proxies     will be accessible through the API product.       The API proxy names must already be deployed to the bound environments,     or creation of the API product will fail. To get a list of deployed API     proxies, run:         $ gcloud apigee deployments list       To deploy an API proxy, run:         $ gcloud apigee apis deploy.        --add-api=[API,...]        Adds a new API to the set of APIs.        --remove-api=[API,...]        Removes an existing API from the set of APIs.      At most one of these can be specified:       --all-environments       Make all environments accessible through this API product.       Environments to which the API product is bound. Requests to environments     that are not listed are rejected, preventing developers from accessing     those resources even if they can access the same API proxies in another     environment.       For example, this can be used to prevent applications with access to     production APIs from accessing the alpha or beta versions of those APIs.       To get a list of available environments, run:         $ gcloud apigee environments list        --add-environment=[ENVIRONMENT,...]        Adds a new environment to the set of environments.        --remove-environment=[ENVIRONMENT,...]        Removes an existing environment from the set of environments.      At most one of these can be specified:       --all-resources       Include all deployed API resources in the product, so long as they       match the other parameters.       API resources to be bundled in the API product.       By default, the resource paths are mapped from the proxy.pathsuffix     variable.       The proxy path suffix is defined as the URI fragment following the     ProxyEndpoint base path. For example, if /forecastrss is given as an     element of this list, and the base path defined for the API proxy is     /weather, then only requests to /weather/forecastrss are permitted by     the API product.       Proxy paths can use asterisks as wildcards; /** indicates that all     sub-URIs are included, whereas a single asterisk indicates that only     URIs one level down are included.       By default, / supports the same resources as /** as well as the base     path defined by the API proxy.       For example, if the base path of the API proxy is /v1/weatherapikey,     then the API product supports requests to /v1/weatherapikey and to any     sub-URIs, such as /v1/weatherapikey/forecastrss,     /v1/weatherapikey/region/CA, and so on.       The API proxy resources must already be deployed to the bound     environments, or creation of the API product will fail.        --add-resource=[RESOURCE#...]        Adds a new resource to the set of resources.        --remove-resource=[RESOURCE#...]        Removes an existing resource from the set of resources.      At most one of these can be specified:       --automatic-approval       Allow developers to generate approved consumer keys without waiting       for approval.       --manual-approval       Require manual approval of developer requests to access this API       product before their consumer keys can be used.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-attributes       Removes all attributes.       Key-value attribute pairs that may be used to extend the default API     product profile with customer-specific metadata. Up to 17 attributes can     be specified.        --add-attribute=[NAME=VALUE,...]        Adds a new attribute to the set of attributes.        --remove-attribute=[NAME,...]        Removes an existing attribute from the set of attributes.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-description       Remove the API product's description.       --description=SET_DESCRIPTION       Overview of the API product. Include key information about the API       product that is not captured by other fields.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-oauth-scopes       Removes all OAuth scopes.       Comma-separated list of OAuth scopes that are validated at runtime.     Apigee validates that the scopes in any access token presented match the     scopes defined in the OAuth policy assoicated with the API product.        --add-oauth-scope=[OAUTH-SCOPE,...]        Adds a new OAuth scope to the set of OAuth scopes.        --remove-oauth-scope=[OAUTH-SCOPE,...]        Removes an existing OAuth scope from the set of OAuth scopes.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-quota       Remove any quota currently imposed on the API product.       To impose a quota limit on calls to the API product, specify all of the     following:        --quota=QUOTA        Number of request messages permitted per app by this API product        for the specified --quota-interval and --quota-unit.          For example, --quota=50, --quota-interval=12, and --quota-unit=hour        means 50 requests are allowed every 12 hours.        --quota-interval=QUOTA_INTERVAL        Time interval over which the number of request messages is        calculated.        --quota-unit=QUOTA_UNIT        Time unit for --quota-interval. QUOTA_UNIT must be one of: minute,        hour, day, month.      At most one of these can be specified:       --internal-access       Prevent external access to this API product.       --private-access       Hide this API product in the developer portal but make it accessible       by external developers.       --public-access       Make this API product visible to developers in the Apigee developer       portal.
