However, if the disk is later detached from       the instance, this option won't apply. The default value for this       is yes.      architecture       Specifies the architecture or processor type that this disk can       support. For available processor types on Compute Engine, see       https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/cpu-platforms.      storage-pool       The name of the storage pool in which the new disk is created. The       new disk and the storage pool must be in the same location.      interface       The interface to use with the disk. The value must be one of the       following:       ▸ SCSI       ▸ NVME      boot       If yes, indicates that this is a boot disk. The instance will use       the first partition of the disk for its root file system.

If the value is not fully qualified then kms-location, kms-keyring,       and optionally kms-project are required.       See       https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption       for more details.      kms-project       Project that contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will protect the       disk.       If the project is not specified then the project where the disk is       being created will be used.       If this flag is set then key-location, kms-keyring, and kms-key are       required.       See       https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption       for more details.      kms-location       Location of the Cloud KMS cryptokey to be used for protecting the       disk.       All Cloud KMS cryptokeys are reside in a 'location'. To get a list       of possible locations run 'gcloud kms locations list'. If this flag       is set then kms-keyring and kms-key are required. See       https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption       for more details.      kms-keyring       The keyring which contains the Cloud KMS cryptokey that will       protect the disk.       If this flag is set then kms-location and kms-key are required.       See       https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-managed-encryption       for more details.      source-snapshot       The source disk snapshot that will be used to create the disk. You       can provide this as a full URL to the snapshot or just the snapshot       name. For example, the following are valid values:       ▸ https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/snapshots/snapshot       ▸ snapshot      confidential-compute       If yes, the disk is created in confidential mode. The default value       is no. Encryption with a Cloud KMS key is required to enable this       option.      replica-zones       Required for each regional disk associated with the instance.       Specify the URLs of the zones where the disk should be replicated       to. You must provide exactly two replica zones, and one zone must       be the same as the instance zone.

This option can only be       specified for the default network interface, nic0.      aliases       Specifies the IP alias ranges to allocate for this interface. If       there are multiple IP alias ranges, they are separated by       semicolons.       For example:         --aliases="10.128.1.0/24;range1:/32"       Each IP alias range consists of a range name and an IP range       separated by a colon, or just the IP range. The range name is the       name of the range within the network interface's subnet from which       to allocate an IP alias range. If unspecified, it defaults to the       primary IP range of the subnet. The IP range can be a CIDR range       (e.g. 192.168.100.0/24), a single IP address (e.g. 192.168.100.1),       or a netmask in CIDR format (e.g. /24). If the IP range is       specified by CIDR range or single IP address, it must belong to the       CIDR range specified by the range name on the subnet. If the IP       range is specified by netmask, the IP allocator will pick an       available range with the specified netmask and allocate it to this       network interface.      network-attachment       Specifies the network attachment that this interface should connect       to.

CONFIDENTIAL_COMPUTE_TYPE must be one of:       SEV        Secure Encrypted Virtualization      SEV_SNP        Secure Encrypted Virtualization - Secure Nested Paging      TDX        Trust Domain eXtension    Custom machine type extensions.     --custom-cpu=CUSTOM_CPU      A whole number value specifying the number of cores that are needed      in the custom machine type.      For some machine types, shared-core values can also be used. For      example, for E2 machine types, you can specify micro, small, or      medium.      This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in      this group are specified.     --custom-memory=CUSTOM_MEMORY      A whole number value indicating how much memory is desired in the      custom machine type. A size unit should be provided (eg. 3072MB or      9GB) - if no units are specified, GB is assumed.      This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in      this group are specified.     --custom-extensions      Use the extended custom machine type.     --custom-vm-type=CUSTOM_VM_TYPE      Specifies a custom machine type. The default is n1. For more      information about custom machine types, see:      https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#custom_machine_types

    /// The Google Cloud project against which all image and image family     references will be resolved. It is best practice to define     image-project. A full list of available projects can be generated by     running gcloud projects list.     ◆ If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be      provided.     ◆ If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple      projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to be      used.     ◆ If not specified and either image or image-family is provided, the      current default project is used.    At most one of these can be specified:     --image=IMAGE      Specifies the boot image for the instances. For each instance, a new      boot disk will be created from the given image. Each boot disk will      have the same name as the instance. To view a list of public images      and projects, run $ gcloud compute images list. It is best practice      to use --image when a specific version of an image is needed.      When using this option, --boot-disk-device-name and --boot-disk-size      can be used to override the boot disk's device name and size,      respectively.     --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY      The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will be      initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux distributions,      some of which are available as both regular and Shielded VM images.      When a family is specified instead of an image, the latest      non-deprecated image associated with that family is used. It is best      practice to use --image-family when the latest version of an image is      needed.      By default, debian-12 is assumed for this flag.     --source-snapshot=SOURCE_SNAPSHOT      The name of the source disk snapshot that the instance boot disk will      be created from. You can provide this as a full URL to the snapshot      or just the snapshot name. For example, the following are valid      values:      ▸ https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/global/snapshots/snapshot      ▸ snapshot    Key resource - The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) cryptokey that will   be used to protect the instance. The 'Compute Engine Service Agent'   service account must hold permission 'Cloud KMS CryptoKey   Encrypter/Decrypter'. The arguments in this group can be used to specify   the attributes of this resource.     --instance-kms-key=INSTANCE_KMS_KEY      ID of the key or fully qualified identifier for the key.      To set the kms-key attribute:      ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-key on the command line.      This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in      this group are specified.     --instance-kms-keyring=INSTANCE_KMS_KEYRING      The KMS keyring of the key.      To set the kms-keyring attribute:      ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-key on the command line with       a fully specified name;      ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-keyring on the command line.     --instance-kms-location=INSTANCE_KMS_LOCATION      The Google Cloud location for the key.      To set the kms-location attribute:      ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-key on the command line with       a fully specified name;      ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-location on the command line.     --instance-kms-project=INSTANCE_KMS_PROJECT      The Google Cloud project for the key.      To set the kms-project attribute:      ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-key on the command line with       a fully specified name;      ▸ provide the argument --instance-kms-project on the command line;      ▸ set the property core/project.    Sole Tenancy.    At most one of these can be specified:     --node=NODE      The name of the node to schedule this instance on.     --node-affinity-file=PATH_TO_FILE      The JSON/YAML file containing the configuration of desired nodes onto      which this instance could be scheduled. These rules filter the nodes      according to their node affinity labels. A node's affinity labels      come from the node template of the group the node is in.      The file should contain a list of a JSON/YAML objects. For an      example, see      https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/nodes/provisioning-sole-tenant-vms#configure_node_affinity_labels.      The following list describes the fields:       key        Corresponds to the node affinity label keys of the Node resource.      operator        Specifies the node selection type. Must be one of: IN: Requires        Compute Engine to seek for matched nodes. NOT_IN: Requires        Compute Engine to avoid certain nodes.      values        Optional. A list of values which correspond to the node affinity        label values of the Node resource.        Use a full or relative path to a local file containing the value        of node_affinity_file.     --node-group=NODE_GROUP      The name of the node group to schedule this instance on.    At most one of these can be specified:     --public-ptr      Creates a DNS PTR record for the external IP of the instance.     --no-public-ptr      If provided, no DNS PTR record is created for the external IP of the      instance. Mutually exclusive with public-ptr-domain.    At most one of these can be specified:     --public-ptr-domain=PUBLIC_PTR_DOMAIN      Assigns a custom PTR domain for the external IP of the instance.      Mutually exclusive with no-public-ptr.     --no-public-ptr-domain      If both this flag and --public-ptr are specified, creates a DNS PTR      record for the external IP of the instance with the PTR domain name      being the DNS name of the instance.    Specifies the reservation for the instance.     --reservation=RESERVATION      The name of the reservation, required when      --reservation-affinity=specific.     --reservation-affinity=RESERVATION_AFFINITY; default="any"      The type of reservation for the instance. RESERVATION_AFFINITY must      be one of:       any        Consume any available, matching reservation.      none        Do not consume from any reserved capacity.      specific        Must consume from a specific reservation.    At most one of these can be specified:     --scopes=[SCOPE,...]      If not provided, the instance will be assigned the default scopes,      described below. However, if neither --scopes nor --no-scopes are      specified and the project has no default service account, then the      instance will be created with no scopes. Note that the level of      access that a service account has is determined by a combination of      access scopes and IAM roles so you must configure both access scopes      and IAM roles for the service account to work properly.      SCOPE can be either the full URI of the scope or an alias. Default      scopes are assigned to all instances.

Its access      tokens can be accessed through the instance metadata server and are      used to authenticate applications on the instance. The account can be      set using an email address corresponding to the required service      account.      If not provided, the instance will use the project's default service      account.     --no-service-account      Create instance without service account
