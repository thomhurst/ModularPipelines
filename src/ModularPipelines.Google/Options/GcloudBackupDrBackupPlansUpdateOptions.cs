    /// Full definition of an existing backup rule with updated values. The      existing backup rule is replaced by this new set of values. This flag      can be repeated to update multiple backup rules. It is not allowed to      pass the same rule-id in this flag more than once in the same command.        Parameters for the backup rule include:        rule-id        Name of the backup rule. The name must be unique and start with a        lowercase letter followed by up to 62 lowercase letters, numbers,        or hyphens.        retention-days        Duration for which backup data should be retained. It must be        defined in "days". The value should be greater than or equal to the        enforced retention period set for the backup vault.        recurrence        Frequency for the backup schedule. It must be either: HOURLY,        DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY or YEARLY.        backup-window-start        Start time of the interval during which backup jobs should be        executed. It can be defined as backup-window-start=2, that means        backup window starts at 2 a.m. The start time and end time must        have an interval of 6 hours.        backup-window-end        End time of the interval during which backup jobs should be        executed. It can be defined as backup-window-end=14, that means        backup window ends at 2 p.m. The start time and end time must have        an interval of 6 hours.          Jobs are queued at the beginning of the window and will be marked        as SKIPPED if they do not start by the end time. Jobs that are in        progress will not be canceled at the end time.        time-zone        The time zone to be used for the backup schedule. The value must        exist in the IANA tz database (https://www.iana.org/time-zones).        The default value is UTC. E.g., Europe/Paris        Following flags are mutually exclusive:        hourly-frequency        Frequency for hourly backups. An hourly frequency of 2 means backup        jobs will run every 2 hours from start time till the end time        defined. The hourly frequency must be between 4 and 23. The value        is needed only if recurrence type is HOURLY.        days-of-week        Days of the week when the backup job should be executed. The value        is needed if recurrence type is WEEKLY. E.g., MONDAY,TUESDAY        days-of-month        Days of the month when the backup job should be executed. The value        is needed only if recurrence type is YEARLY. E.g.,"1,5,14"        months        Month for the backup schedule. The value is needed only if        recurrence type is YEARLY. E.g., JANUARY, MARCH        week-day-of-month        Recurring day of the week in the month or year when the backup job        should be executed. E.g. FIRST-SUNDAY, THIRD-MONDAY. The value can        only be provided if the recurrence type is MONTHLY or YEARLY.        Allowed values for the number of week - FIRST, SECOND, THIRD,        FOURTH, LAST. Allowed values for days of the week - MONDAY to        SUNDAY.        E.g.,      "rule-id=sample-daily-rule,recurrence=WEEKLY,backup-window-start=2,backup-window-end=14,retention-days=20,days-of-week='SUNDAY      MONDAY'"
