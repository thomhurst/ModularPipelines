    /// Zone of the instances to delete. If not specified, you might be      prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to      identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your      currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud      prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform      zones.        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the      compute/zone property:          $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE        A list of zones can be fetched by running:          $ gcloud compute zones list        To unset the property, run:          $ gcloud config unset compute/zone        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable      CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.      At most one of these can be specified:       --delete-disks=DISK_TYPE       The types of disks to delete with instance deletion regardless of the       disks' auto-delete configuration. When this flag is provided, the       auto-delete bits on the attached disks are modified accordingly       before the instance deletion requests are issued. For more       information on disk auto-deletion, see Set the auto-delete state of a       zonal persistent disk       (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/modify-persistent-disk#updateautodelete).       DISK_TYPE must be one of:         all         All disk types.       boot         The first partition is reserved for the root filesystem.       data         A non-boot disk.       --keep-disks=DISK_TYPE       The types of disks to not delete with instance deletion regardless of       the disks' auto-delete configuration. When this flag is provided, the       auto-delete bits on the attached disks are modified accordingly       before the instance deletion requests are issued.
