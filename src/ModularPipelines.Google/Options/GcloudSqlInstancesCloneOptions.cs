    /// The time the source instance was deleted. This is required if cloning      from a deleted instance.      At most one of these can be specified:       Binary log coordinates for point-in-time recovery.        --bin-log-file-name=BIN_LOG_FILE_NAME        The name of the binary log file. Enable point-in-time recovery on        the source instance to create a binary log file. If specified with        &lt;--bin-log-position&gt; to form a valid binary log coordinate, it        defines an earlier point in time to clone a source instance from.        For example, mysql-bin.000001.          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments        in this group are specified.        --bin-log-position=BIN_LOG_POSITION        Represents the state of an instance at any given point in time        inside a binary log file. If specified along with        &lt;--bin-log-file-name&gt; to form a valid binary log coordinate, it        defines an earlier point in time to clone a source instance from.        For example, 123 (a numeric value).          This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments        in this group are specified.       --point-in-time=POINT_IN_TIME       Represents the state of an instance at any given point in time inside       a transaction log file. For MySQL, the binary log file is used for       transaction logs. For PostgreSQL, the write-ahead log file is used       for transaction logs. For SQL Server, the log backup file is used for       such purpose. To create a transaction log, enable point-in-time       recovery on the source instance. Instance should have transaction       logs accumulated up to the point in time they want to restore up to.       Uses RFC 3339 format in UTC timezone. If specified, defines a past       state of the instance to clone. For example,       '2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z'.         This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in       this group are specified.       --restore-database-name=RESTORE_DATABASE_NAME       The name of the database to be restored for a point-in-time restore.       If set, the destination instance will only restore the specified       database.
