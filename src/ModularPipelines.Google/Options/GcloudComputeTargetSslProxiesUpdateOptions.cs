PROXY_V1       Enables PROXY protocol (version 1) for passing client connection       information.    At most one of these can be specified:     --clear-ssl-policy      Removes any attached SSL policy from the SSL proxy.     --ssl-policy=SSL_POLICY      A reference to an SSL policy resource that defines the server-side      support for SSL features and affects the connections between clients      and load balancers that are using the SSL proxy. The SSL policy must      exist and cannot be deleted while referenced by a target SSL proxy.     At most one of these can be specified:      --global-ssl-policy       If set, the SSL policy is global.      --ssl-policy-region=SSL_POLICY_REGION       Region of the SSL policy to operate on. Overrides the default       compute/region property value for this command invocation.    At most one of these can be specified:     --ssl-certificates=SSL_CERTIFICATE,[...]      References to at most 15 SSL certificate resources that are used for      server-side authentication. The first SSL certificate in this list is      considered the primary SSL certificate associated with the load      balancer. The SSL certificates must exist and cannot be deleted while      referenced by a target SSL proxy.     --clear-ssl-certificates      Remove any attached SSL certificates from the SSL proxy.     Certificate map resource - The certificate map to attach. This    represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given    arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.     To set the project attribute:     ▸ provide the argument --certificate-map on the command line with a      fully specified name;     ▸ provide the argument --project on the command line;     ▸ set the property core/project.     To set the location attribute:     ▸ provide the argument --certificate-map on the command line with a      fully specified name;     ▸ default value of location is [global].      --certificate-map=CERTIFICATE_MAP       ID of the certificate map or fully qualified identifier for the       certificate map.       To set the map attribute:       ▫ provide the argument --certificate-map on the command line.     --clear-certificate-map      Removes any attached certificate map from the SSL proxy.
