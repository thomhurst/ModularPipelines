The following keywords may be referenced in the expressions:     ◆ assertion: JSON representing the authentication credential issued      by the Provider.     ◆ google: The Google attributes mapped from the assertion in the      attribute_mappings. google.profile_photo and google.display_name are      not supported.     ◆ attribute: The custom attributes mapped from the assertion in the      attribute_mappings.     The maximum length of the attribute condition expression is 4096     characters. If unspecified, all valid authentication credential will be     accepted.

Each key must be a string specifying the Google Cloud IAM attribute to     be produced.     The following predefined keys are currently supported:     ◆ google.subject: required field that indicates the principal that is      being authenticated to IAM, and will be logged in all API accesses      for which Cloud Audit Logging is configured.     ◆ google.groups: optional field that indicates asserted groups that      the user should be considered to belong to. You can create IAM      bindings using the groups attribute and access to a resource will be      granted if any of the groups asserted here match a group in the      respective binding.     ◆ google.display_name: optional field that overrides the name of the      user. If not set, google.subject will be displayed instead. This      attribute cannot be used in IAM policies. The maximum length of this      field is 100 characters.     ◆ google.profile_photo: optional fields that may be set to a valid      URL specifying the user's thumbnail photo. When set, the image will      be visible as the user's profile picture. If not set, a generic user      icon will be displayed instead. This attribute cannot be used in IAM      policies.     Custom attributes can also be mapped by specifying     attribute.{custom_attribute}, replacing {custom_attribute} with the     name of the custom attribute to be mapped. A maximum of 50 custom     attribute mappings can be defined. The maximum length of a mapped     attribute key is 2048 characters and may only contain the characters     [a-z0-9].     These attributes can then be referenced in IAM policies to define     fine-grained access for the workforce pool to Google Cloud resources by     specifying:     ◆ google.subject:      principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool}/subject/{value}     ◆ google.groups:      principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool}/group/{value}     ◆ attribute.{custom_attribute}:      principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool}/attribute.{custom_attribute}/{value}     Each value must be a Common Expression Language     (https://opensource.google/projects/cel) function that maps an Identity     Provider credential to the normalized attribute specified by the     corresponding map key.     The following keywords may be referenced in the expressions:     ◆ assertion: JSON representing the authentication credential issued      by the Identity Provider.     The maximum length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048     characters. When evaluated, the total size of all mapped attributes     must not exceed 8KB.     Example: Map the sub claim of the incoming credential to the subject     Google Cloud IAM attribute.       {"google.subject": "assertion.sub"}
