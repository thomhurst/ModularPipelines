    /// Comma-separated list of OAuth scopes that are validated at runtime.      Apigee validates that the scopes in any access token presented match      the scopes defined in the OAuth policy assoicated with the API product.      At most one of these can be specified:       --all-environments       Make all environments accessible through this API product.       --environments=ENVIRONMENT,[ENVIRONMENT,...]       Environments to which the API product is bound. Requests to       environments that are not listed are rejected, preventing developers       from accessing those resources through API Proxies deployed in       another environment.         For example, this can prevent resources associated with API proxies       in a prod environment from also granting access to matching API       proxies deployed in a test environment.         To get a list of available environments, run:           $ gcloud apigee environments list      Arguments specifying which API proxies and resources to expose.      At most one of these can be specified:       --all-proxies       Expose all available API proxies and their resources. Must be       explicitly specified if neither --apis nor --resources is provided.       Arguments that restrict exposed API proxies. One or both of these may be     specified if --all-proxies is not:        --apis=[API,...]        Comma-separated names of API proxies to which this API product is        bound. Only those API proxies will be accessible through the new        API product.          If not provided, all deployed API proxies will be included in the        product, so long as they match the other parameters.          The API proxy names must already be deployed to the bound        environments, or creation of the API product will fail. To get a        list of deployed API proxies, run:            $ gcloud apigee deployments list          To deploy an API proxy, run:            $ gcloud apigee apis deploy        --resources=RESOURCE#[RESOURCE#...]        API resources to be bundled in the API product, separated by #        signs.          By default, the resource paths are mapped from the proxy.pathsuffix        variable.          The proxy path suffix is defined as the URI fragment following the        ProxyEndpoint base path. For example, if /forecastrss is given as        an element of this list, and the base path defined for the API        proxy is /weather, then only requests to /weather/forecastrss are        permitted by the API product.          Proxy paths can use asterisks as wildcards; /** indicates that all        sub-URIs are included, whereas a single asterisk indicates that        only URIs one level down are included.          By default, / supports the same resources as /** as well as the        base path defined by the API proxy.          For example, if the base path of the API proxy is        /v1/weatherapikey, then the API product supports requests to        /v1/weatherapikey and to any sub-URIs, such as        /v1/weatherapikey/forecastrss, /v1/weatherapikey/region/CA, and so        on.          If not provided, all deployed API resources will be included in the        product, so long as they match the other parameters.          The API proxy resources must already be deployed to the bound        environments, or creation of the API product will fail.      At most one of these can be specified:       --internal-access       Prevent external access to this API product.       --private-access       Hide this API product in the developer portal but make it accessible       by external developers.       --public-access       Make this API product visible to developers in the Apigee developer       portal.      To impose a quota limit on calls to the API product, specify all of the    following:       --quota=QUOTA       Number of request messages permitted per app by this API product for       the specified --quota-interval and --quota-unit.         For example, to create an API product that allows 50 requests every       twelve hours to every deployed API proxy, run:           $ gcloud apigee products create PRODUCT --all-environments \          --all-proxies --public-access --quota=50 --quota-interval=12 \          --quota-unit=hour         If specified, --quota-interval and --quota-unit must be specified       too.       --quota-interval=QUOTA_INTERVAL       Time interval over which the number of request messages is       calculated.         If specified, --quota and --quota-unit must be specified too.       --quota-unit=QUOTA_UNIT       Time unit for --quota-interval.         If specified, --quota and --quota-interval must be specified too.         QUOTA_UNIT must be one of: minute, hour, day, month.
