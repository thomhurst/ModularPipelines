You can only specify this provisioning model if you        want your VM instances to consume a specific reservation with        either a calendar reservation mode or a dense deployment type.      SPOT        Compute Engine may stop a Spot VM instance whenever it needs        capacity. Because Spot VM instances don't have a guaranteed        runtime, they come at a discounted price.      STANDARD        The default option. The STANDARD provisioning model gives you full        control over your VM instances' runtime.

    /// Zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified, you might be      prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only). gcloud attempts to      identify the appropriate zone by searching for resources in your      currently active project. If the zone cannot be determined, gcloud      prompts you for a selection with all available Google Cloud Platform      zones.        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, the user can set the      compute/zone property:          $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE        A list of zones can be fetched by running:          $ gcloud compute zones list        To unset the property, run:          $ gcloud config unset compute/zone        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable      CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.      Discard Local SSDs At Termination Timestamp      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-discard-local-ssds-at-termination-timestamp       Removes the discard-local-ssds-at-termination-timestamp field from       the scheduling options.       --discard-local-ssds-at-termination-timestamp=DISCARD_LOCAL_SSDS_AT_TERMINATION_TIMESTAMP       Required to be set to true and only allowed for VMs that have one or       more local SSDs, use --instance-termination-action=STOP, and use       either --max-run-duration or --termination-time.         This flag indicates the value that you want Compute Engine to use for       the --discard-local-ssd flag in the automatic gcloud compute       instances stop command. This flag only supports the true value, which       discards local SSD data when automatically stopping this VM during       its terminationTimestamp.         For more information about the --discard-local-ssd flag, see       https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#stop_instance.      Instance Termination Action      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-instance-termination-action       Disables the termination action for this VM if allowed OR sets       termination action to the default value. Depending on a VM's       availability settings, a termination action is either required or not       allowed. This flag is required when you are updating a VM such that       it's previously specified termination action is no longer allowed. If       you use this flag when a VM requires a termination action, it's       termination action is just set to the default value (stop).       --instance-termination-action=INSTANCE_TERMINATION_ACTION       Specifies the termination action that will be taken upon VM       preemption (--provisioning-model=SPOT) or automatic instance       termination (--max-run-duration or --termination-time).         INSTANCE_TERMINATION_ACTION must be one of:         DELETE         Permanently delete the VM.       STOP         Default only for Spot VMs. Stop the VM without preserving memory.         The VM can be restarted later.      Max Run Duration      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-max-run-duration       Removes the max-run-duration field from the scheduling options.       --max-run-duration=MAX_RUN_DURATION       Limits how long this VM instance can run, specified as a duration       relative to the last time when the VM began running. Format the       duration, MAX_RUN_DURATION, as the number of days, hours, minutes,       and seconds followed by d, h, m, and s respectively. For example,       specify 30m for a duration of 30 minutes or specify 1d2h3m4s for a       duration of 1 day, 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 4 seconds. Alternatively,       to specify a timestamp, use --termination-time instead.         If neither --max-run-duration nor --termination-time is specified       (default), the VM instance runs until prompted by a user action or       system event. If either is specified, the VM instance is scheduled to       be automatically terminated at the VM's termination timestamp       (terminationTimestamp) using the action specified by       --instance-termination-action.         Note: The terminationTimestamp is removed whenever the VM is stopped       or suspended and redefined whenever the VM is rerun. For       --max-run-duration specifically, the terminationTimestamp is the sum       of MAX_RUN_DURATION and the time when the VM last entered the RUNNING       state, which changes whenever the VM is rerun.      Sole Tenancy.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-node-affinities       Removes the node affinities field from the instance. If specified,       the instance node settings will be cleared. The instance will not be       scheduled onto a sole-tenant node.       --node=NODE       The name of the node to schedule this instance on.       --node-affinity-file=PATH_TO_FILE       The JSON/YAML file containing the configuration of desired nodes onto       which this instance could be scheduled. These rules filter the nodes       according to their node affinity labels. A node's affinity labels       come from the node template of the group the node is in.         The file should contain a list of a JSON/YAML objects. For an       example, see       https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/nodes/provisioning-sole-tenant-vms#configure_node_affinity_labels.       The following list describes the fields:         key         Corresponds to the node affinity label keys of the Node resource.       operator         Specifies the node selection type. Must be one of: IN: Requires         Compute Engine to seek for matched nodes. NOT_IN: Requires         Compute Engine to avoid certain nodes.       values         Optional. A list of values which correspond to the node affinity         label values of the Node resource.           Use a full or relative path to a local file containing the value         of node_affinity_file.       --node-group=NODE_GROUP       The name of the node group to schedule this instance on.      Termination Time      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-termination-time       Removes the termination-time field from the scheduling options.       --termination-time=TERMINATION_TIME       Limits how long this VM instance can run, specified as a time. Format       the time, TERMINATION_TIME, as a RFC 3339 timestamp. For more       information, see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339. Alternatively,       to specify a duration, use --max-run-duration instead.         If neither --termination-time nor --max-run-duration is specified       (default), the VM instance runs until prompted by a user action or       system event. If either is specified, the VM instance is scheduled to       be automatically terminated at the VM's termination timestamp       (terminationTimestamp) using the action specified by       --instance-termination-action.         Note: The terminationTimestamp is removed whenever the VM is stopped       or suspended and redefined whenever the VM is rerun. For       --termination-time specifically, the terminationTimestamp remains the       same whenever the VM is rerun, but any requests to rerun the VM fail       if the specified timestamp is in the past.
