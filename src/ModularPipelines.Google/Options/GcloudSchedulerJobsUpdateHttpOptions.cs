    /// Schedule on which the job will be executed.     As a general rule, execution n + 1 of a job will not begin until     execution n has finished. Cloud Scheduler will never allow two     simultaneously outstanding executions. For example, this implies that     if the n+1 execution is scheduled to run at 16:00 but the n execution     takes until 16:15, the n+1 execution will not start until 16:15. A     scheduled start time will be delayed if the previous execution has not     ended when its scheduled time occurs. Learn more about the cron job     format     (https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/configuring/cron-job-schedules).     If --retry-count &gt; 0 and a job attempt fails, the job will be tried a     total of --retry-count times, with exponential backoff, until the job     succeeds or the number of retries is exhausted. Note that the next     scheduled execution time might be skipped if the retries continue     through that time. For more information, see Retry jobs     (https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/configuring/retry-jobs).

    /// The full URI path that the request will be sent to. This string must     begin with either "http://" or "https://". For example, http://acme.com     or https://acme.com/sales:8080. Cloud Scheduler will encode some     characters for safety and compatibility. The maximum allowed URL length     is 2083 characters after encoding.    How the request sent to the target when executing the job should be   authenticated.    At most one of these can be specified:     --clear-auth-token      Clear the auth token fields: --oidc-service-account-email,      --oidc-token-audience, --oauth-service-account-email, and      --oauth-token-scope.     OAuth2      --oauth-service-account-email=OAUTH_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL       The service account email to be used for generating an OAuth2       access token to be included in the request sent to the target when       executing the job. The service account must be within the same       project as the job. The caller must have iam.serviceAccounts.actAs       permission for the service account. The token must be OAuth if the       target is a Google APIs service with URL *.googleapis.com.       This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments       in this group are specified.      --oauth-token-scope=OAUTH_TOKEN_SCOPE       The scope to be used when generating an OAuth2 access token to be       included in the request sent to the target when executing the job.       If not specified, "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"       will be used.     OpenId Connect      --oidc-service-account-email=OIDC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL       The service account email to be used for generating an OpenId       Connect token to be included in the request sent to the target when       executing the job. The service account must be within the same       project as the job. The caller must have iam.serviceAccounts.actAs       permission for the service account. The OIDC token is generally       used except for Google APIs hosted on *.googleapis.com: these APIs       expect an OAuth token.       This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments       in this group are specified.      --oidc-token-audience=OIDC_TOKEN_AUDIENCE       The audience to be used when generating an OpenId Connect token to       be included in the request sent to the target when executing the       job. If not specified, the URI specified in target will be used.    At most one of these can be specified:     --clear-headers      Clear the list of HTTP headers.     --remove-headers=[REMOVE_HEADERS,...]      KEY1,KEY2 list of HTTP headers to remove from the request.      --remove-headers Accept-Language,Accept     --update-headers=[KEY=VALUE,...]      KEY=VALUE pairs of HTTP headers to include in the request. Cannot be      repeated. For example: --update-headers      Accept-Language=en-us,Accept=text/plain    At most one of these can be specified:     --clear-max-backoff      Clear the field corresponding to --max-backoff.     --max-backoff=MAX_BACKOFF; default="3600s"      Maximum amount of time to wait before retrying a job after it fails.      For example, 60s. Default is 3600s (1 hour).    At most one of these can be specified:     --clear-max-doublings      Clear the field corresponding to --max-doublings.     --max-doublings=MAX_DOUBLINGS; default=5      Maximum number of times that the interval between failed job retries      will be doubled before the increase becomes constant.    At most one of these can be specified:     --clear-max-retry-attempts      Clear the field corresponding to --max-retry-attempts.     --max-retry-attempts=MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS      Number of times to retry the request if it fails or times out. Must      be in range 0-5 inclusive. Default is 0.    At most one of these can be specified:     --clear-max-retry-duration      Clear the field corresponding to --max-retry-duration.     --max-retry-duration=MAX_RETRY_DURATION      Time limit for retrying a failed job, measured from when the job was      first run. If specified with --max-retry-attempts greater than 0, the      job will be retried until both limits are reached. Default is 0      seconds (which means unlimited); however, if --max-retry-attempts is      also 0, a job attempt won't be retried if it fails.    At most one of these can be specified:     --clear-message-body      Clear the field corresponding to --message-body or      --message-body-from-file.     --message-body=MESSAGE_BODY      Data payload to be included as the body of the HTTP request. May only      be given with compatible HTTP methods (PUT or POST).     --message-body-from-file=PATH_TO_FILE      Path to file containing the data payload to be included as the body      of the HTTP request. May only be given with compatible HTTP methods      (PUT or POST). Use a full or relative path to a local file containing      the value of message_body.    At most one of these can be specified:     --clear-min-backoff      Clear the field corresponding to --min-backoff.     --min-backoff=MIN_BACKOFF; default="5s"      Minimum amount of time to wait before retrying a job after it fails.      For example, 10s. Default is 5s.    At most one of these can be specified:     --clear-time-zone      Clear the field corresponding to --time-zone.     --time-zone=TIME_ZONE; default="Etc/UTC"      Specifies the time zone to be used in interpreting --schedule. The      value of this field must be a time zone name from the tz database      (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).      Note that some time zones include a provision for daylight savings      time. The rules for daylight saving time are determined by the chosen      time zone.      For UTC use the string "utc". Default is "utc".
