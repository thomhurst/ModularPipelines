    /// List of Aspect keys, identifying Aspects to remove from the entry.        Keys are in the format ASPECT_TYPE@PATH, or just ASPECT_TYPE, if the      Aspect is attached to an entry itself rather than to a specific column      defined in the schema.        ASPECT_TYPE is expected to be in a format      PROJECT_ID.LOCATION.ASPECT_TYPE_ID or a wildcard *, which targets all      aspect types.        PATH can be either empty (which means a 'root' path, such that Aspect      is attached to the entry itself), point to a specific column defined in      the schema (for example: Schema.some_column) or a wildcard * (target      all paths).        ASPECT_TYPE and PATH cannot be both specified as wildcards *.        If both --update-aspects and --remove-aspects flags are specified, and      the same aspect key is used in both flags, then --update-aspects takes      precedence, and such an aspect will be updated and not removed.

    /// <summary>
    /// Path to a YAML or JSON file containing Aspects to add or update.        When this flag is specified, only Aspects referenced in the file are      going to be added or updated. Specifying this flag does not remove any      Aspects from the entry. In other words, specifying this flag will not      lead to a full replacement of Aspects with a contents of the provided      file.        Content of the file contains a map, where keys are in the format      ASPECT_TYPE@PATH, or just ASPECT_TYPE, if the Aspect is attached to an      entry itself rather than to a specific column defined in the schema.        Values in the map represent Aspect's content, which must conform to a      template defined for a given ASPECT_TYPE. Each Aspect will be replaced      fully by the provided content. That means data in the Aspect will be      replaced and not merged with existing contents of that Aspect in the      Entry.        ASPECT_TYPE is expected to be in a format      PROJECT_ID.LOCATION.ASPECT_TYPE_ID.        PATH can be either empty (which means a 'root' path, such that Aspect      is attached to the entry itself) or point to a specific column defined      in the schema. For example: Schema.some_column.        Example YAML format:           project-id1.us-central1.my-aspect-type1:          data:           aspectField1: someValue           aspectField2: someOtherValue         project-id2.us-central1.my-aspect-type2@Schema.column1:          data:           aspectField3: someValue3        Example JSON format:           {          "project-id1.us-central1.my-aspect-type1": {           "data": {            "aspectField1": "someValue",            "aspectField2": "someOtherValue"           }          },          "project-id2.us-central1.my-aspect-type2@Schema.column1": {           "data": {            "aspectField3": "someValue3"           }          }         }        If both --update-aspects and --remove-aspects flags are specified, and      the same aspect key is used in both flags, then --update-aspects takes      precedence, and such an aspect will be updated and not removed.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-fully-qualified-name       Clear the FQN for the Entry.       --fully-qualified-name=FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAME       FQN, a name for the entry that can reference it in an external       system.      Source system related information for an entry. If any of the entry source    fields are specified, then ``--entry-source-update-time must be specified    as well.       --entry-source-update-time=DATE_TIME       The update date and time of the resource in the source system.         This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in       this group are specified.       At most one of these can be specified:        --clear-entry-source-create-time        Clear the value for the create_time field in the Entry Source.        --entry-source-create-time=DATE_TIME        The creation date and time of the resource in the source system.       At most one of these can be specified:        --clear-entry-source-description        Clear the value for the description field in the Entry Source.        --entry-source-description=DESCRIPTION        Description of the Entry.       At most one of these can be specified:        --clear-entry-source-display-name        Clear the value for the display_name field in the Entry Source.        --entry-source-display-name=DISPLAY_NAME        User friendly display name.       At most one of these can be specified:        --clear-entry-source-labels        Clear the labels for the Entry Source.        --entry-source-labels=[KEY=VALUE,...]        List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.          Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens        (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values        must contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase        characters, and numbers.       At most one of these can be specified:        --clear-entry-source-platform        Clear the value for the platform field in the Entry Source.        --entry-source-platform=PLATFORM_NAME        The platform containing the source system.       At most one of these can be specified:        --clear-entry-source-resource        Clear the value for the resource field in the Entry Source.        --entry-source-resource=RESOURCE        The name of the resource in the source system.       At most one of these can be specified:        --clear-entry-source-system        Clear the value for the system field in the Entry Source.        --entry-source-system=SYSTEM_NAME        The name of the source system.
