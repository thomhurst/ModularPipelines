    /// The type of session affinity to use. Supports both TCP and UDP.     SESSION_AFFINITY must be one of:      CLIENT_IP       Route requests to instances based on the hash of the client's IP       address.     CLIENT_IP_NO_DESTINATION       Directs a particular client's request to the same backend VM based       on a hash created on the client's IP address only. This is used in       L4 ILB as Next-Hop scenarios. It differs from the Client-IP option       in that Client-IP uses a hash based on both client-IP's address and       destination address.     CLIENT_IP_PORT_PROTO       (Applicable if --load-balancing-scheme is INTERNAL) Connections       from the same client IP with the same IP protocol and port will go       to the same backend VM while that VM remains healthy.     CLIENT_IP_PROTO       (Applicable if --load-balancing-scheme is INTERNAL) Connections       from the same client IP with the same IP protocol will go to the       same backend VM while that VM remains healthy.     GENERATED_COOKIE       (Applicable if --load-balancing-scheme is INTERNAL_MANAGED,       INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, EXTERNAL_MANAGED, or EXTERNAL) If the       --load-balancing-scheme is EXTERNAL or EXTERNAL_MANAGED, routes       requests to backend VMs or endpoints in a NEG, based on the       contents of the GCLB cookie set by the load balancer. Only       applicable when --protocol is HTTP, HTTPS,HTTP2 or H2C. If the       --load-balancing-scheme is INTERNAL_MANAGED or       INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, routes requests to backend VMs or endpoints       in a NEG, based on the contents of the GCILB cookie set by the       proxy. (If no cookie is present, the proxy chooses a backend VM or       endpoint and sends a Set-Cookie response for future requests.) If       the --load-balancing-scheme is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, routes       requests to backend VMs or endpoints in a NEG, based on the       contents of a cookie set by Traffic Director. This session affinity       is only valid if the load balancing locality policy is either       RING_HASH or MAGLEV.     HEADER_FIELD       (Applicable if --load-balancing-scheme is INTERNAL_MANAGED,       EXTERNAL_MANAGED, or INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED) Route requests to       backend VMs or endpoints in a NEG based on the value of the HTTP       header named in the --custom-request-header flag. This session       affinity is only valid if the load balancing locality policy is       either RING_HASH or MAGLEV and the backend service's consistent       hash specifies the name of the HTTP header.     HTTP_COOKIE       (Applicable if --load-balancing-scheme is INTERNAL_MANAGED,       EXTERNAL_MANAGED or INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED) Route requests to       backend VMs or endpoints in a NEG, based on an HTTP cookie in the       --affinity-cookie-name flag (with the optional       --affinity-cookie-ttl flag). If the client has not provided the       cookie, the proxy generates the cookie and returns it to the client       in a Set-Cookie header. This session affinity is only valid if the       load balancing locality policy is either RING_HASH or MAGLEV and       the backend service's consistent hash specifies the HTTP cookie.     NONE       Session affinity is disabled.     STRONG_COOKIE_AFFINITY       (Applicable if --load-balancing-scheme is INTERNAL_MANAGED or       EXTERNAL_MANAGED) Strong cookie-based affinity, based on an HTTP       cookie named in the --affinity-cookie-name flag (with the optional       --affinity-cookie-ttl flag). Connections bearing the same cookie       will be served by the same backend VM while that VM remains       healthy, as long as the cookie has not expired. If the       --affinity-cookie-ttl flag is set to 0, the cookie will be treated       as a session cookie.
