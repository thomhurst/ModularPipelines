The following keys are accepted:        name        Required. An identifier, such as load-balancer-exclusion.        Identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only        letters, digits, underscores, hyphens, and periods.        description        Optional. A description of this exclusion.        filter        Optional. Entries that match this advanced log filter will be        excluded. Filter cannot be empty.        disabled        Optional. To disable an exclusion, include this key and specify any        value. To enable a disabled exclusion, include this key, but do not        specify any value. Do not include this key unless you want to        change its value.      Settings for sink exporting data to BigQuery.       --use-partitioned-tables       If specified, use BigQuery's partitioned tables. By default, Logging       creates dated tables based on the log entries' timestamps, e.g.       'syslog_20170523'. Partitioned tables remove the suffix and special       query syntax       (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables)       must be used.      At most one of these can be specified:       --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID       Billing account of the sink to update.       --folder=FOLDER_ID       Folder of the sink to update.       --organization=ORGANIZATION_ID       Organization of the sink to update.       --project=PROJECT_ID       Project of the sink to update.         The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,       then the current project is assumed; the current project can be       listed using gcloud config list --format='text(core.project)' and can       be set using gcloud config set project PROJECTID.         --project and its fallback core/project property play two roles in       the invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate       on. It also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota,       and billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing,       use --billing-project or billing/quota_project property.
