NETWORK_FIREWALL_POLICY_ENFORCEMENT_ORDER must be one of:      AFTER_CLASSIC_FIREWALL       Network Firewall Policy is enforced after classic firewall.     BEFORE_CLASSIC_FIREWALL       Network Firewall Policy is enforced before classic firewall.    BGP Best Path Selection flags     --bgp-best-path-selection-mode=BGP_BEST_PATH_SELECTION_MODE      The BGP best path selection algorithm to be employed.      BGP_BEST_PATH_SELECTION_MODE must be one of:       LEGACY        Dynamic routes are ranked based on the multiple        exit-discriminator (MED) BGP attribute. When global routing is        enabled, the MED of the routes received from other regions is the        original MED plus the region-to-region cost.      STANDARD        Dynamic routes are ranked based on AS Path, Origin, Neighbor ASN        and MED BGP attributes. When global routing is enabled,        region-to-region cost is used as a tiebreaker. This mode offers        customizations to fine-tune BGP best path routing with additional        flags like --bgp-bps-always-compare-med and        --bgp-bps-inter-region-cost     --[no-]bgp-bps-always-compare-med      Enables/disables the comparison of MED across routes with different      Neighbor ASNs. This value can only be set if the      --bgp-best-path-selection-mode is STANDARD. Use      --bgp-bps-always-compare-med to enable and      --no-bgp-bps-always-compare-med to disable.     --bgp-bps-inter-region-cost=BGP_BPS_INTER_REGION_COST      Defines the preferred approach for handling inter-region cost in the      selection process. This value can only be set if the      --bgp-best-path-selection-mode is STANDARD. BGP_BPS_INTER_REGION_COST      must be one of:       ADD_COST_TO_MED        Adds inter-region cost to the MED before comparing the MED value.        When multiple routes have the same value after the        Add-cost-to-med comparison, the route selection continues and        prefers the route with lowest cost.      DEFAULT        MED is compared as originally received from peers. When multiple        routes have the same MED, cost is evaluated as the next step.    At most one of these can be specified:     --bgp-routing-mode=MODE      The target BGP routing mode for this network. MODE must be one of:       global        Cloud Routers in this network advertise subnetworks from all        regions to their BGP peers, and program instances in all regions        with the router's best learned BGP routes.      regional        Cloud Routers in this network advertise subnetworks from their        local region only to their BGP peers, and program instances in        their local region only with the router's best learned BGP        routes.     --switch-to-custom-subnet-mode      Switch to custom subnet mode. This action cannot be undone.
