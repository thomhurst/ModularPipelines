See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration      formats.        BGP systems exchange keepalive messages to determine whether a link or      host has failed or is no longer available. Hold time is the length of      time in seconds that the BGP session is considered operational without      any activity. After the hold time expires, the session is dropped.        Hold time is three times the interval at which keepalive messages are      sent, and the hold time is the maximum number of seconds allowed to      elapse between successive keepalive messages that BGP receives from a      peer. BGP will use the smaller of either the local hold time value or      the peer's hold time value as the hold time for the BGP connection      between the two peers.
