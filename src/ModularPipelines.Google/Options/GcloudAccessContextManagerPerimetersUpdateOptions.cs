    /// Type of the perimeter.     A regular perimeter allows resources within this service perimeter to     import and export data amongst themselves. A project may belong to at     most one regular service perimeter.     A bridge perimeter allows resources in different regular service     perimeters to import and export data between each other. A project may     belong to multiple bridge service perimeters (only if it also belongs     to a regular service perimeter). Both restricted and unrestricted     service lists, as well as access level lists, must be empty.     TYPE must be one of: bridge, regular.    These flags modify the member access levels of this perimeter. An   intra-perimeter request must satisfy these access levels (for example,   MY_LEVEL; must be in the same access policy as this perimeter) to be   allowed.    At most one of these can be specified:     --add-access-levels=[LEVEL,...]      Append the given values to the current access levels.     --clear-access-levels      Empty the current access levels.     --remove-access-levels=[LEVEL,...]      Remove the given values from the current access levels.     --set-access-levels=[LEVEL,...]      Completely replace the current access levels with the given values.    These flags modify the member resources of this perimeter. Resources must   be projects, in the form projects/&lt;projectnumber&gt;.    At most one of these can be specified:     --add-resources=[RESOURCES,...]      Append the given values to the current resources.     --clear-resources      Empty the current resources.     --remove-resources=[RESOURCES,...]      Remove the given values from the current resources.     --set-resources=[RESOURCES,...]      Completely replace the current resources with the given values.    These flags modify the member restricted services of this perimeter. The   perimeter boundary DOES apply to these services (for example,   storage.googleapis.com).    At most one of these can be specified:     --add-restricted-services=[SERVICE,...]      Append the given values to the current restricted services.     --clear-restricted-services      Empty the current restricted services.     --remove-restricted-services=[SERVICE,...]      Remove the given values from the current restricted services.     --set-restricted-services=[SERVICE,...]      Completely replace the current restricted services with the given      values.    These flags modify the enforced EgressPolicies of this ServicePerimeter.    At most one of these can be specified:     --clear-egress-policies      Empties existing enforced Egress Policies.     --set-egress-policies=YAML_FILE      Path to a file containing a list of Egress Policies.      This file contains a list of YAML-compliant objects representing      Egress Policies described in the API reference.
