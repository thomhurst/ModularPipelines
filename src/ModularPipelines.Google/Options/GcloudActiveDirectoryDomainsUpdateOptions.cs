    /// List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value      is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens      (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must      contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and      numbers.      At most one of these can be specified:       --add-authorized-networks=[AUTH_NET1, AUTH_NET2, ...,...]       A list of URLs of additional networks to peer this domain to in the       form projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}. Networks must       belong to the project.       --remove-authorized-networks=[AUTH_NET1, AUTH_NET2, ...,...]       A list of URLs of additional networks to unpeer this domain from in       the form projects/{project}/global/networks/{network}. Networks must       belong to the project.      At most one of these can be specified:       --add-region=ADD_REGION       An additional region to provision this domain in. If domain is       already provisioned in region, nothing will be done in that region.       Supported regions are: asia-east1, asia-northeast1, asia-south1,       asia-southeast1, australia-southeast1, europe-north1, europe-west1,       europe-west2, europe-west3, europe-west4, northamerica-northeast1,       southamerica-east1, us-central1, us-east1, us-east4, us-west1,       us-west2.       --remove-region=REMOVE_REGION       A region to de-provision this domain from. If domain is already not       provisioned in a region, nothing will be done in that region. Domains       must be left provisioned in at least one region. Supported regions       are: asia-east1, asia-northeast1, asia-south1, asia-southeast1,       australia-southeast1, europe-north1, europe-west1, europe-west2,       europe-west3, europe-west4, northamerica-northeast1,       southamerica-east1, us-central1, us-east1, us-east4, us-west1,       us-west2.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-labels       Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then       --clear-labels is applied first.         For example, to remove all labels:           $ gcloud active-directory domains update --clear-labels         To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:           $ gcloud active-directory domains update --clear-labels \          --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]       List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is       silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then       --update-labels is applied first.
