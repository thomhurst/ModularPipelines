The value must be a whole number followed by        a size unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte,        or TB for terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte        disk. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB. If not specified, the        default image size will be used for the new disk.        type        The type of the disk.

The default disk type is        pd-standard.        device-name        An optional name to display the disk name in the guest operating        system. Must be the same as name if used with        --container-mount-disk. If omitted, a device name of the form        persistent-disk-N is used. If omitted and used with        --container-mount-disk (where the name of the container mount disk        is the same as in this flag), a device name equal to disk name is        used.        provisioned-iops        Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the disk. This sets the        number of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle. Value        must be between 10,000 and 120,000.        provisioned-throughput        Indicates how much throughput to provision for the disk. This sets        the number of throughput mb per second that the disk can handle.        disk-resource-policy        Resource policy to apply to the disk. Specify a full or partial        URL.

For available processor types on Compute Engine, see        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/cpu-platforms.        storage-pool        The name of the storage pool in which the new disk is created. The        new disk and the storage pool must be in the same location.        interface        The interface to use with the disk. The value must be one of the        following:        + SCSI        + NVME        replica-zones        Required for each regional disk associated with the instance.

For example:            --aliases="10.128.1.0/24;range1:/32"          Each IP alias range consists of a range name and an IP range        separated by a colon, or just the IP range. The range name is the        name of the range within the network interface's subnet from which        to allocate an IP alias range. If unspecified, it defaults to the        primary IP range of the subnet. The IP range can be a CIDR range        (e.g. 192.168.100.0/24), a single IP address (e.g. 192.168.100.1),        or a netmask in CIDR format (e.g. /24). If the IP range is        specified by CIDR range or single IP address, it must belong to the        CIDR range specified by the range name on the subnet.
