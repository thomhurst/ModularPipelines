    /// Note: This flag only applies to Rollout Sequencing v1, not Rollout      Sequencing v2 (which uses custom stages). If using Rollout Sequencing      v1 and this flag is not provided, a default value of 7 days will be      used.        Configures the default soaking duration for each upgrade propagating      through the current fleet to become "COMPLETE". Soaking begins after      all clusters in the fleet are on the target version, or after 30 days      if all cluster upgrades are not complete. Once an upgrade state becomes      "COMPLETE", it will automatically be propagated to the downstream      fleet. Max is 30 days.        To configure Rollout Sequencing for a fleet, this attribute must be      set. To do this while specifying a default soaking duration of 7 days,      run:          $ gcloud container hub clusterupgrade create \          --default-upgrade-soaking=7d

Defines a specific soaking time override for a particular upgrade    propagating through the current fleet that supercedes the default soaking    duration configured by --default-upgrade-soaking.      To set an upgrade soaking override of 12 hours for the upgrade with name,    k8s_control_plane, and version, 1.23.1-gke.1000, run:        $ gcloud container hub clusterupgrade create        \        --add-upgrade-soaking-override=12h        \        --upgrade-selector=name="k8s_control_plane",\      version="1.23.1-gke.1000"       --add-upgrade-soaking-override=ADD_UPGRADE_SOAKING_OVERRIDE       Overrides the soaking time for a particular upgrade name and version       propagating through the current fleet. Set soaking to 0 days to       bypass soaking and fast-forward the upgrade to the downstream fleet.         See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.         This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in       this group are specified.       --upgrade-selector=[name=NAME],[version=VERSION]       Name and version of the upgrade to be overridden where version is a       full GKE version. Currently, name can be either k8s_control_plane or       k8s_node.         This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in       this group are specified.
