    /// (DEPRECATED) When compare_duration is set, the result's "state_change"      attribute is updated to indicate whether the finding had its state      changed, the finding's state remained unchanged, or if the finding was      added during the compare_duration period of time that precedes the      read_time. This is the time between (read_time - compare_duration) and      read_time. The state_change value is derived based on the presence and      state of the finding at the two points in time. Intermediate state      changes between the two times don't affect the result. For example, the      results aren't affected if the finding is made inactive and then active      again. Possible "state_change" values when compare_duration is      specified:        * 'CHANGED': indicates that the finding was present at the start of       compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time.        * 'UNCHANGED': indicates that the finding was present at the start of       compare_duration and did not change state at read_time.        * 'ADDED': indicates that the finding was not present at the start of       compare_duration, but was present at read_time.        * 'REMOVED': indicates that the finding was present at the start of       compare_duration, but was not present at read_time.          If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible        state_change is 'UNUSED', which will be the state_change set for all        findings present at read_time. If this field is set then 'state_change'        must be a specified field in 'group_by'. See $ gcloud topic datetimes        for information on supported duration formats.        The --compare-duration option is deprecated. For more information, see      the deprecation notice      (https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/release-notes#April_15_2024)      on the SCC release notes page.
