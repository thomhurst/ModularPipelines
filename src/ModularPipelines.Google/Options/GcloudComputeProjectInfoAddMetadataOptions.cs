    /// Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on      the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an      equals sign. Each metadata key must be unique and have a max of 128      bytes in length. Each value must have a max of 256 KB in length.      Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g., --metadata      key-1=value-1,key-2=value-2,key-3=value-3. The combined total size for      all metadata entries is 512 KB.        In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, such as the      official images (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images), the      following metadata keys have special meanings:        startup-script        Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they        start running. For convenience, --metadata-from-file can be used to        pull the value from a file.        startup-script-url        Same as startup-script except that the script contents are pulled        from a publicly-accessible location on the web.          For startup scripts on Windows instances, the following metadata        keys have special meanings: windows-startup-script-url,        windows-startup-script-cmd, windows-startup-script-bat,        windows-startup-script-ps1, sysprep-specialize-script-url,        sysprep-specialize-script-cmd, sysprep-specialize-script-bat, and        sysprep-specialize-script-ps1. For more information, see Running        startup scripts        (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript).          At least one of [--metadata] or [--metadata-from-file] is required.
