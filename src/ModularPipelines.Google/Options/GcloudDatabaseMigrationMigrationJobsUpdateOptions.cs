Values must     contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and     numbers.    The migration job objects config.     The migration job objects config for databases.     At most one of these can be specified:      --all-databases       Migrate all databases for the migration job. This flag is used only       for Postgres to AlloyDB migrations and Postgres to Cloud SQL       Postgres migrations.      --databases-filter=databaseName,[...]       A list of databases to be migrated to the destination instance.       Provide databases as a comma separated list. This flag is used only       for Postgres to AlloyDB migrations and Postgres to Cloud SQL       Postgres migrations.    At most one of these can be specified:     --clear-labels      Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then      --clear-labels is applied first.      For example, to remove all labels:        $ gcloud database-migration migration-jobs update --clear-labels      To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:        $ gcloud database-migration migration-jobs update --clear-labels \         --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux     --remove-labels=[KEY,...]      List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is      silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then      --update-labels is applied first.    At most one of these can be specified:     --dump-flags=[KEY=VALUE,...]      A list of dump flags. An object containing a list of "key": "value"      pairs.     --dump-path=DUMP_PATH      Path to the dump file in Google Cloud Storage, in the format:      gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/[OBJECT_NAME].    The heterogeneous migration config. This is used only for Oracle to Cloud   SQL for PostgreSQL and SQL Server to Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL migrations.     Configuration for Oracle or SQL Server as a source in a heterogeneous    migration.      --max-concurrent-cdc-connections=MAX_CONCURRENT_CDC_CONNECTIONS       Maximum number of connections Database Migration Service will open       to the source for CDC phase.      --max-concurrent-full-dump-connections=MAX_CONCURRENT_FULL_DUMP_CONNECTIONS       Maximum number of connections Database Migration Service will open       to the source for full dump phase.     Configuration for Postgres as a destination in a heterogeneous    migration.      --max-concurrent-destination-connections=MAX_CONCURRENT_DESTINATION_CONNECTIONS       Maximum number of concurrent connections Database Migration Service       will open to the destination for data migration.      --transaction-timeout=TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT       Timeout for data migration transactions.    The connectivity method used by the migration job. If a connectivity   method isn't specified, then it isn't updated for the migration job.    At most one of these can be specified:     --peer-vpc=PEER_VPC      Name of the VPC network to peer with the Cloud SQL private network.     --static-ip      Use the default IP allowlist method. This method creates a public IP      that will be used with the destination Cloud SQL database. The method      works by configuring the source database server to accept connections      from the outgoing IP of the Cloud SQL instance.     Parameters for the reverse-SSH tunnel connectivity method.      --vm=VM       Name of VM that will host the SSH tunnel bastion.      --vm-ip=VM_IP       Bastion Virtual Machine IP.      --vm-port=VM_PORT       Forwarding port for the SSH tunnel.      --vpc=VPC       Name of the VPC network where the VM is hosted.    At most one of these can be specified:     The SQL Server homogeneous migration config. This is used only for SQL    Server to CloudSQL SQL Server migrations.      --sqlserver-databases=databaseName,[...]       A list of databases to be migrated to the destination Cloud SQL       instance. Provide databases as a comma separated list. This list       should contain all encrypted and non-encrypted database names. This       flag is used only for SQL Server to Cloud SQL migrations.      --sqlserver-diff-backup       Enable differential backups. If not specified, differential backups       are disabled by default. Use --sqlserver-diff-backup to enable and       --no-sqlserver-diff-backup to disable. This flag is used only for       homogeneous SQL Server to Cloud SQL for SQL Server migrations.      --sqlserver-encrypted-databases=SQLSERVER_ENCRYPTED_DATABASES       A JSON/YAML file describing the encryption settings per database       for all encrytped databases. Note: Path to the Certificate (.cer)       and Private Key (.pvk) in Cloud Storage, should be in the form of       gs://bucketName/fileName. The instance must have write permissions       to the bucket and read access to the file. An example of a JSON       request: [{ "database": "db1", "encryptionOptions": { "certPath":       "Path to certificate 1", "pvkPath": "Path to certificate private       key 1", "pvkPassword": "Private key password 1" } }, { "database":       "db2", "encryptionOptions": { "certPath": "Path to certificate 2",       "pvkPath": "Path to certificate private key 2", "pvkPassword":       "Private key password 2" } }]         This flag accepts "-" for stdin. This flag is used only for SQL Server to Cloud SQL migrations.      --sqlserver-promote-when-ready       Promote the database when it is ready. Use       --sqlserver-promote-when-ready to enable and       --no-sqlserver-promote-when-ready to disable. This flag is used       only for homogeneous SQL Server to Cloud SQL for SQL Server       migrations.
