Must be of the form `X[.Y[.Z]]`, where `[]` denotes optional fragments.         Examples: `2`, `2.3`, `2.3.4`.           The current Cloud Composer version will be used within the created         environment. The Apache Airflow version is a semantic version or an alias         in the form of major or major.minor version numbers, resolved to the         latest matching Apache Airflow version supported in the current Cloud         Composer version. The resolved version is stored in the created         environment.       --image-version=IMAGE_VERSION       Version of the image to run in the environment.           The image version encapsulates the versions of both Cloud Composer         and Apache Airflow. Must be of the form         `composer-A[.B.C[-D.E]]-airflow-X[.Y[.Z]]`, where `[]` denotes optional         fragments.

The Cloud Composer portion of the image version is a semantic version or         an alias in the form of major version number or `latest`, resolved to the         current Cloud Composer version. The Apache Airflow portion of the image         version is a semantic version or an alias in the form of major or         major.minor version numbers, resolved to the latest matching Apache         Airflow version supported in the given Cloud Composer version. The         resolved versions are stored in the created environment.      Private Clusters       --cloud-sql-ipv4-cidr=CLOUD_SQL_IPV4_CIDR       IPv4 CIDR range to use for the Cloud SQL network. This should have a       size of the netmask not greater than 24.         Cannot be specified unless --enable-private-environment is also       specified.       --composer-network-ipv4-cidr=COMPOSER_NETWORK_IPV4_CIDR       IPv4 CIDR range to use for the Composer network. This must have a       size of the netmask between 24 and 29.         Can be specified for Composer 2.X or greater. Cannot be specified       unless --enable-private-environment is also specified.       --connection-subnetwork=CONNECTION_SUBNETWORK       Subnetwork from which an IP address for internal communications will       be reserved. Needs to belong to the Compute network to which the       environment is connected. Can be the same subnetwork as the one to       which the environment is connected.         Can be specified for Composer 2.X or greater. Cannot be specified       unless --enable-private-environment is also specified.       --connection-type=CONNECTION_TYPE       Mode of internal communication within the Composer environment. Must       be one of VPC_PEERING or PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT.         Can be specified for Composer 2.X or greater. Cannot be specified       unless --enable-private-environment is also specified. Cannot be set       to VPC_PEERING if --connection-subnetwork is also specified.         CONNECTION_TYPE must be one of: connection-type-unspecified,       private-service-connect, vpc-peering.       --disable-private-environment       Enables internet connection for Composer components.         When used with Composer 2, this means the environment cluster is       created with public IP addresses on the cluster nodes.       --enable-private-endpoint       Environment cluster is managed using the private IP address of the       master API endpoint. Therefore access to the master endpoint must be       from internal IP addresses.         If not specified, the master API endpoint will be accessible by its       public IP address.         Cannot be specified unless --enable-private-environment is also       specified.       --enable-private-environment       Disables internet connection from any Composer component.         When used with Composer 2, the environment cluster is created with no       public IP addresses on the cluster nodes. If not specified, cluster       nodes will be assigned public IP addresses.         When used with Composer 1.x, cannot be specified unless       --enable-ip-alias is also specified.       --enable-privately-used-public-ips       When enabled GKE pods and services may use public(non-RFC1918) IP       ranges privately. The ranges are specified by '--cluster-ipv4-cidr'       and --services-ipv4-cidr flags.         Cannot be specified unless --enable-private-environment is also       specified.       --master-ipv4-cidr=MASTER_IPV4_CIDR       IPv4 CIDR range to use for the cluster master network. This should       have a size of the netmask between 23 and 28.         Cannot be specified unless --enable-private-environment is also       specified.       --web-server-ipv4-cidr=WEB_SERVER_IPV4_CIDR       IPv4 CIDR range to use for the Airflow web server network. This       should have a size of the netmask between 24 and 29.         Cannot be specified unless --enable-private-environment is also       specified.      IP Alias (VPC-native)       --cluster-ipv4-cidr=CLUSTER_IPV4_CIDR       IP address range for the pods in this cluster in CIDR notation (e.g.       10.0.0.0/14).         When used with Composer 1.x, cannot be specified unless       --enable-ip-alias is also specified.       --cluster-secondary-range-name=CLUSTER_SECONDARY_RANGE_NAME       Secondary range to be used as the source for pod IPs. Alias ranges       will be allocated from this secondary range. NAME must be the name of       an existing secondary range in the cluster subnetwork.         When used with Composer 1.x, cannot be specified unless       --enable-ip-alias is also specified.       --enable-ip-alias       Enable use of alias IPs       (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/alias-ip/) for Pod IPs. This       will require at least two secondary ranges in the subnetwork, one for       the pod IPs and another to reserve space for the services range.       --enable-ip-masq-agent       When enabled, the IP Masquarade Agent       (https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/enable-ip-masquerade-agent)       is deployed to your environment's cluster. It performs many-to-one IP       address translations to hide a pod's IP address behind the cluster       node's IP address. This is done when sending traffic to destinations       outside the cluster's pod CIDR range.         When used with Composer 1.x, cannot be specified unless       --enable-ip-alias is also specified.       --services-ipv4-cidr=SERVICES_IPV4_CIDR       IP range for the services IPs.         Can be specified as a netmask size (e.g. '/20') or as in CIDR notion       (e.g. '10.100.0.0/20'). If given as a netmask size, the IP range will       be chosen automatically from the available space in the network.         If unspecified, the services CIDR range will be chosen with a default       mask size.         When used with Composer 1.x, cannot be specified unless       --enable-ip-alias is also specified.       --services-secondary-range-name=SERVICES_SECONDARY_RANGE_NAME       Secondary range to be used for services (e.g. ClusterIPs). NAME must       be the name of an existing secondary range in the cluster subnetwork.         When used with Composer 1.x, cannot be specified unless       --enable-ip-alias is also specified.      Group of arguments for setting dag processor settings in Composer 3 or    greater.       --dag-processor-count=DAG_PROCESSOR_COUNT       Number of dag processors, supported in Composer 3 environments or       greater.       --dag-processor-cpu=DAG_PROCESSOR_CPU       CPU allocated to Airflow dag processor, supported in Composer 3       environments or greater.       --dag-processor-memory=DAG_PROCESSOR_MEMORY       Memory allocated to Airflow dag processor, ex. 1GB, 3GB, 2.
