    /// Set the mode of an autoscaler for a managed instance group.     You can turn off or restrict a group's autoscaler activities without     affecting your autoscaler configuration. The autoscaler configuration     persists while the activities are turned off or restricted, and the     activities resume when the autoscaler is turned on again or when the     restrictions are lifted.     MODE must be one of:      off       Turns off autoscaling, while keeping the new configuration.     on       Permits autoscaling to scale out and in (default for new       autoscalers).     only-scale-out       Permits autoscaling to scale only out and not in.     only-up       (DEPRECATED) Permits autoscaling to scale only out and not in.       Value only-up is deprecated. Use --mode only-scale-out instead.    At most one of these can be specified:     --clear-scale-in-control      If specified, the scale-in-control field will be cleared. Using this      flag will remove any configuration set by --scale-in-control flag.     --scale-in-control=[max-scaled-in-replicas=MAX-SCALED-IN-REPLICAS],[max-scaled-in-replicas-percent=MAX-SCALED-IN-REPLICAS-PERCENT],[time-window=TIME-WINDOW]      Configuration that allows slower scale in so that even if Autoscaler      recommends an abrupt scale in of a managed instance group, it will be      throttled as specified by the parameters.       max-scaled-in-replicas        Maximum allowed number of VMs that can be deducted from the peak        recommendation during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be        deleted at once so the application needs to be prepared to lose        that many VMs in one step. Mutually exclusive with        'max-scaled-in-replicas-percent'.       max-scaled-in-replicas-percent        Maximum allowed percent of VMs that can be deducted from the peak        recommendation during the window. Possibly all these VMs can be        deleted at once so the application needs to be prepared to lose        that many VMs in one step. Mutually exclusive with        'max-scaled-in-replicas'.       time-window        How long back autoscaling should look when computing        recommendations. The autoscaler will not resize below the maximum        allowed deduction subtracted from the peak size observed in this        period. Measured in seconds.    At most one of these can be specified:     --disable-schedule=SCHEDULE_NAME      Name of the scaling schedule to be disabled.      When a scaling schedule is disabled its configuration persists but      the scaling schedule itself never becomes active. If you disable a      scaling schedule that is currently active the disabled scaling      schedule stops being effective immediately after it moves into      DISABLED state. If there is no need to maintain capacity, the      autoscaler starts removing instances after the usual stabilization      period and after scale-in controls (if configured). For more      information, see Delays in scaling in      (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/understanding-autoscaler-decisions#delays_in_scaling_in)      and Scale-in controls      (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/understanding-autoscaler-decisions#scale-in_controls).      This ensures you don't accidentally lose capacity immediately after      the scaling schedule ends.     --enable-schedule=SCHEDULE_NAME      Name of the scaling schedule to be enabled.      See --disable-schedule for details.     --remove-schedule=SCHEDULE_NAME      Name of the scaling schedule to be removed.      Be careful with this action as scaling schedule deletion cannot be      undone.      You can delete any schedule regardless of its status. If you delete a      scaling schedule that is currently active, the deleted scaling      schedule stops being effective immediately after it is deleted. If      there is no need to maintain capacity, the autoscaler starts removing      instances after the usual stabilization period and after scale-in      controls (if configured). For more information, see Delays in scaling      in      (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/understanding-autoscaler-decisions#delays_in_scaling_in)      and Scale-in controls      (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/understanding-autoscaler-decisions#scale-in_controls).      This ensures you don't accidentally lose capacity immediately after      the scaling schedule ends.     --set-schedule=SCHEDULE_NAME      A unique name for the scaling schedule to be configured.     --update-schedule=SCHEDULE_NAME      Name of the scaling schedule to be updated.    At most one of these can be specified:     --region=REGION      Region of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,      you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).      A list of regions can be fetched by running:        $ gcloud compute regions list      Overrides the default compute/region property value for this command      invocation.     --zone=ZONE      Zone of the managed instance group to operate on. If not specified,      you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode only).      A list of zones can be fetched by running:        $ gcloud compute zones list      Overrides the default compute/zone property value for this command      invocation.

After the configured duration, if there     is no need to maintain capacity, the autoscaler starts removing     instances after the usual stabilization period and after scale-in     controls (if configured). For more information, see Delays in scaling     in     (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/understanding-autoscaler-decisions#delays_in_scaling_in)     and Scale-in controls     (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/autoscaler/understanding-autoscaler-decisions#scale-in_controls).
