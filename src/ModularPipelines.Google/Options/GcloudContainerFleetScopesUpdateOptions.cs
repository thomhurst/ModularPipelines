    /// List of scope-level label KEY=VALUE pairs to update in the cluster      namespace. If a label exists, its value is modified. Otherwise, a new      label is' created.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-labels       Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then       --clear-labels is applied first.         For example, to remove all labels:           $ gcloud container fleet scopes update --clear-labels         To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:           $ gcloud container fleet scopes update --clear-labels \          --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]       List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is       silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then       --update-labels is applied first.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-namespace-labels       Remove all scope-level labels from the cluster namespace. If       --update-namespace-labels is also specified then       --clear-namespace-labels is applied first.         For example, to remove all labels:           $ gcloud container fleet scopes update scope_name \          --clear-namespace-labels         To remove all existing scope-level labels and create two new labels,       foo and baz:           $ gcloud container fleet scopes update scope_name \          --clear-namespace-labels \          --update-namespace-labels foo=bar,baz=qux       --remove-namespace-labels=[KEY,...]       List of scope-level label keys to remove in the cluster namespace. If       a label does not exist it is silently ignored. If       --update-namespace-labels is also specified then       --update-namespace-labels is applied first.      Rollout Sequencing       --default-upgrade-soaking=DEFAULT_UPGRADE_SOAKING       Configures the default soaking duration for each upgrade propagating       through the current scope to become "COMPLETE". Soaking begins after       all clusters in the scope are on the target version, or after 30 days       if all cluster upgrades are not complete. Once an upgrade state       becomes "COMPLETE", it will automatically be propagated to the       downstream scope. Max is 30 days.         See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.         To configure Rollout Sequencing for a given scope, SCOPE_NAME, this       attribute must be set. To do this while specifying a default soaking       duration of 7 days, run:           $ gcloud container fleet scopes update SCOPE_NAME \           default-upgrade-soaking=7d       At most one of these can be specified:        --remove-upgrade-soaking-overrides        Removes soaking time overrides for all upgrades propagating through        the current scope. Consequently, all upgrades will follow the soak        time configured by --default-upgrade-soaking until new overrides        are configured with --add_upgrade_soaking_override and        --upgrade_selector.          To remove all soaking time overrides configured for SCOPE_NAME,        run:            $ gcloud container fleet scopes update SCOPE_NAME \            --remove-upgrade-soaking-overrides        Upgrade soaking override.        Defines a specific soaking time override for a particular upgrade      propagating through the current scope that supercedes the default      soaking duration configured by --default-upgrade-soaking.        To set an upgrade soaking override of 12 hours for the upgrade with      name, k8s_control_plane, and version, 1.23.1-gke.1000, run:          $ gcloud container fleet scopes update SCOPE_NAME \         --add-upgrade-soaking-override=12h \         --upgrade-selector=name="k8s_control_plane",version="1.23.1-gke.1000"         --add-upgrade-soaking-override=ADD_UPGRADE_SOAKING_OVERRIDE         Overrides the soaking time for a particular upgrade name and         version propagating through the current scope. Set soaking to 0         days to bypass soaking and fast-forward the upgrade to the         downstream scope.           See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on duration formats.           This flag argument must be specified if any of the other         arguments in this group are specified.         --upgrade-selector=[name=NAME],[version=VERSION]         Name and version of the upgrade to be overridden where version is         a full GKE version. Currently, name can be either         k8s_control_plane or k8s_node.           This flag argument must be specified if any of the other         arguments in this group are specified.       At most one of these can be specified:        --reset-upstream-scope        Clears the relationship between the current scope and its upstream        scope in the rollout sequence.          To remove the link between SCOPE_NAME and its upstream scope, run:            $ gcloud container fleet scopes update SCOPE_NAME \            --reset-upstream-scope        --upstream-scope=UPSTREAM_SCOPE        Full resource name of the upstream scope in the format of        projects/{project}/locations/{location}/scopes/{scope}. GKE will        finish upgrades on the upstream scope before applying the same        upgrades to the current scope.          To configure the upstream scope for SCOPE_NAME, run:            $ gcloud container fleet scopes update SCOPE_NAME \           --upstream-scope=projects/{upstream_project}/locations/global/scopes/{upstream_scope}
