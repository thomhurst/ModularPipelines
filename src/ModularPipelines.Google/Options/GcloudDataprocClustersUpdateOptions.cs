    /// The graceful decommission timeout for decommissioning Node Managers in     the cluster, used when removing nodes. Graceful decommissioning allows     removing nodes from the cluster without interrupting jobs in progress.     Timeout specifies how long to wait for jobs in progress to finish     before forcefully removing nodes (and potentially interrupting jobs).     Timeout defaults to 0 if not set (for forceful decommission), and the     maximum allowed timeout is 1 day. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for     information on duration formats.

Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens     (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must     contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and     numbers.    At most one of these can be specified:     Autoscaling policy resource - The autoscaling policy to use. This    represents a Cloud resource. (NOTE) Some attributes are not given    arguments in this group but can be set in other ways.     To set the project attribute:     ▸ provide the argument --autoscaling-policy on the command line with      a fully specified name;     ▸ provide the argument --project on the command line;     ▸ set the property core/project.     To set the region attribute:     ▸ provide the argument --autoscaling-policy on the command line with      a fully specified name;     ▸ provide the argument --region on the command line;     ▸ set the property dataproc/region.      --autoscaling-policy=AUTOSCALING_POLICY       ID of the autoscaling policy or fully qualified identifier for the       autoscaling policy.       To set the autoscaling_policy attribute:       ▫ provide the argument --autoscaling-policy on the command line.     --disable-autoscaling      Disable autoscaling, if it is enabled. This is an alias for passing      the empty string to --autoscaling-policy'.    At most one of these can be specified:     --clear-labels      Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then      --clear-labels is applied first.      For example, to remove all labels:        $ gcloud dataproc clusters update --clear-labels      To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:        $ gcloud dataproc clusters update --clear-labels \         --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux     --remove-labels=[KEY,...]      List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is      silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then      --update-labels is applied first.    At most one of these can be specified:     --delete-expiration-time=DELETE_EXPIRATION_TIME      The time when the cluster will be auto-deleted, such as      "2017-08-29T18:52:51.142Z". See $ gcloud topic datetimes for      information on time formats.     --delete-max-age=DELETE_MAX_AGE      The lifespan of the cluster with auto-deletion upon completion, such      as "2h" or "1d". See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on      duration formats.     --no-delete-max-age      Cancels the cluster auto-deletion by maximum cluster age (configured      by --delete-max-age or --delete-expiration-time flags)    At most one of these can be specified:     --delete-max-idle=DELETE_MAX_IDLE      The duration after the last job completes to auto-delete the cluster,      such as "2h" or "1d". See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on      duration formats.     --no-delete-max-idle      Cancels the cluster auto-deletion by cluster idle duration      (configured by --delete-max-idle flag)    At most one of these can be specified:     --identity-config-file=IDENTITY_CONFIG_FILE      Path to a YAML (or JSON) file that contains the configuration for      Secure Multi-Tenancy on the cluster. The path can be a Cloud Storage      URL (example: 'gs://path/to/file') or a local filesystem path. The      mappings provided in the file will overwrite existing mappings.      The YAML file is formatted as follows:         # Mapping header (first line) required.         user_service_account_mapping:          bob@company.com: service-account-bob@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com          alice@company.com: service-account-alice@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com     --add-user-mappings=[KEY=VALUE,...]      List of user-to-service-account mappings to add to current mappings.      If a mapping exists, its value is modified; otherwise, the new      mapping is added.     --remove-user-mappings=[KEY,...]      List of user-to-service-account mappings to remove from the current      mappings. If a mapping does not exist, it is ignored.    At most one of these can be specified:     --stop-expiration-time=STOP_EXPIRATION_TIME      The time when the cluster will be auto-stopped, such as      "2017-08-29T18:52:51.142Z". See $ gcloud topic datetimes for      information on time formats.     --stop-max-age=STOP_MAX_AGE      The lifespan of the cluster, with auto-stop upon completion, such as      "2h" or "1d". See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on      duration formats.     --no-stop-max-age      Cancels the cluster auto-stop by maximum cluster age (configured by      --stop-max-age or --stop-expiration-time flags)    At most one of these can be specified:     --stop-max-idle=STOP_MAX_IDLE      The duration after the last job completes to auto-stop the cluster,      such as "2h" or "1d". See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on      duration formats.     --no-stop-max-idle      Cancels the cluster auto-stop by cluster idle duration (configured by      --stop-max-idle flag)
