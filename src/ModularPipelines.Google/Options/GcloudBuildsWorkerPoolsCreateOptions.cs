    /// Cloud region where the worker pool is created. See     https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/locations for available locations.    At most one of these can be specified:     --config-from-file=CONFIG_FROM_FILE      File that contains the configuration for the worker pool to be      created. See      https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/private-pools/worker-pool-config-file-schema      for options.     Command-line flags to configure the private pool:      Configuration to be used for creating workers in the worker pool:       --worker-disk-size=WORKER_DISK_SIZE        Size of the disk attached to the worker.        If unspecified, Cloud Build uses a standard disk size.       --worker-machine-type=WORKER_MACHINE_TYPE        Compute Engine machine type for a worker pool.        If unspecified, Cloud Build uses a standard machine type.      Network configuration for Service Networking:       --peered-network=PEERED_NETWORK        Existing network to which workers are peered. The network is        specified in resource URL format        projects/{network_project}/global/networks/{network_name}.        If not specified, the workers are not peered to any network.       --peered-network-ip-range=PEERED_NETWORK_IP_RANGE        An IP range for your peered network. Specify the IP range using        Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation with a slash and        the subnet prefix size, such as /29.        Your subnet prefix size must be between 1 and 29. Optional: you        can specify an IP address before the subnet prefix value - for        example 192.168.0.0/24.        If no IP address is specified, your VPC automatically determines        the starting IP for the range. If no IP range is specified, Cloud        Build uses /24 as the default network IP range.       --no-public-egress        If set, workers in the worker pool are created without an        external IP address.        If the worker pool is within a VPC Service Control perimeter, use        this flag.
