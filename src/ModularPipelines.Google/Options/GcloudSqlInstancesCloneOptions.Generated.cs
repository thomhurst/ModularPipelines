    /// The time the source instance was deleted. This is required if cloning     from a deleted instance.    At most one of these can be specified:     Binary log coordinates for point-in-time recovery.     --bin-log-file-name=BIN_LOG_FILE_NAME      The name of the binary log file. Enable point-in-time recovery on the      source instance to create a binary log file. If specified with      &lt;--bin-log-position&gt; to form a valid binary log coordinate, it      defines an earlier point in time to clone a source instance from. For      example, mysql-bin.000001.      This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in      this group are specified.     --bin-log-position=BIN_LOG_POSITION      Represents the state of an instance at any given point in time inside      a binary log file. If specified along with &lt;--bin-log-file-name&gt; to      form a valid binary log coordinate, it defines an earlier point in      time to clone a source instance from. For example, 123 (a numeric      value).      This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in      this group are specified.     --point-in-time=POINT_IN_TIME      Represents the state of an instance at any given point in time inside      a transaction log file. For MySQL, the binary log file is used for      transaction logs. For PostgreSQL, the write-ahead log file is used      for transaction logs. For SQL Server, the log backup file is used for      such purpose. To create a transaction log, enable point-in-time      recovery on the source instance. Instance should have transaction      logs accumulated up to the point in time they want to restore up to.      Uses RFC 3339 format in UTC timezone. If specified, defines a past      state of the instance to clone. For example,      '2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z'.      This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in      this group are specified.     --restore-database-name=RESTORE_DATABASE_NAME      The name of the database to be restored for a point-in-time restore.      If set, the destination instance will only restore the specified      database.
