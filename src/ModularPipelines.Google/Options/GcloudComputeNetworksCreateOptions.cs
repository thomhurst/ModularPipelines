BGP Best Path Selection flags       --bgp-best-path-selection-mode=BGP_BEST_PATH_SELECTION_MODE       The BGP best path selection algorithm to be employed.       BGP_BEST_PATH_SELECTION_MODE must be one of:         LEGACY         Dynamic routes are ranked based on the multiple         exit-discriminator (MED) BGP attribute. When global routing is         enabled, the MED of the routes received from other regions is the         original MED plus the region-to-region cost.       STANDARD         Dynamic routes are ranked based on AS Path, Origin, Neighbor ASN         and MED BGP attributes. When global routing is enabled,         region-to-region cost is used as a tiebreaker. This mode offers         customizations to fine-tune BGP best path routing with additional         flags like --bgp-bps-always-compare-med and         --bgp-bps-inter-region-cost       --[no-]bgp-bps-always-compare-med       Enables/disables the comparison of MED across routes with different       Neighbor ASNs. This value can only be set if the       --bgp-best-path-selection-mode is STANDARD. Use       --bgp-bps-always-compare-med to enable and       --no-bgp-bps-always-compare-med to disable.       --bgp-bps-inter-region-cost=BGP_BPS_INTER_REGION_COST       Defines the preferred approach for handling inter-region cost in the       selection process. This value can only be set if the       --bgp-best-path-selection-mode is STANDARD. BGP_BPS_INTER_REGION_COST       must be one of:         ADD_COST_TO_MED         Adds inter-region cost to the MED before comparing the MED value.         When multiple routes have the same value after the         Add-cost-to-med comparison, the route selection continues and         prefers the route with lowest cost.       DEFAULT         MED is compared as originally received from peers. When multiple         routes have the same MED, cost is evaluated as the next step.
