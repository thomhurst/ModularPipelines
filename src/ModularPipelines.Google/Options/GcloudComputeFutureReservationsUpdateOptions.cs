To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the      compute/zone property:          $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE        A list of zones can be fetched by running:          $ gcloud compute zones list        To unset the property, run:          $ gcloud config unset compute/zone        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable      CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.      Manage the auto-delete time properties.      At most one of these can be specified:       --auto-created-reservations-delete-time=AUTO_CREATED_RESERVATIONS_DELETE_TIME       Automatically deletes an auto-created reservations at a specific       time. The specified time must be an RFC3339 timestamp, which must be       formatted as "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" where YYYY = year, MM = month, DD       = day, HH = hours, MM = minutes, SS = seconds, and Z = time zone in       Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example, specify       2021-11-20T07:00:00Z.       --auto-created-reservations-duration=AUTO_CREATED_RESERVATIONS_DURATION       Automatically deletes an auto-created reservations after a specified       number of days, hours, minutes, or seconds. For example, specify 30m       for 30 minutes, or 1d2h3m4s for 1 day, 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 4       seconds. For more information, see $ gcloud topic datetimes.      Manage the name-prefix of a future reservation.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-name-prefix       Clears the name prefix for the system generated reservations.       --name-prefix=NAME_PREFIX       A name prefix for the auto-created reservations when capacity is       delivered at the start time. Each auto-created reservation name       starts with the name prefix.      Manage the properties of a shared future reservation.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-share-settings       Clear share settings on future reservation. This will result in       non-shared future reservation.       Manage the share settings of a future reservation.        --share-setting=SHARE_SETTING        Specify if this future reservation is shared, and if so, the type        of sharing. If you omit this flag, this value is local by default.        SHARE_SETTING must be one of: local, projects.        --share-with=PROJECT,[PROJECT,...]        If this future reservation is shared, provide a comma-separated        list of projects that this future reservation is shared with. The        list must contain project IDs or project numbers.      Manage the commitment info properties       --commitment-name=COMMITMENT_NAME       Name of commitment covering the delivered reservation at the time of       delivery of future reservations. If not specified, it takes the name       of the future reservation.       --commitment-plan=COMMITMENT_PLAN       The plan for this commitment to be created, which determines duration       and discount rate. The currently supported plans are TWELVE_MONTH (1       year), and THIRTY_SIX_MONTH (3 years). COMMITMENT_PLAN must be one       of: TWELVE_MONTH, THIRTY_SIX_MONTH.       --previous-commitment-terms=PREVIOUS_COMMITMENT_TERMS       Applicable only if future reservation will deliver to an existing       reservation with a ramp plan. When set to EXTEND, all associated       parent Committed Used Discount's end-date/term will be extended to       the end-time of this future reservation. Default is to extend       previous commitment's time to the end_time of the reservation.       PREVIOUS_COMMITMENT_TERMS must be (only one value is supported):       EXTEND.      Manage the specific SKU reservation properties.       --machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE       The type of machine (name only) that has a fixed number of vCPUs and       a fixed amount of memory. You can also specify a custom machine type       by using the pattern custom-number_of_CPUs-amount_of_memory-for       example, custom-32-29440.       --min-cpu-platform=MIN_CPU_PLATFORM       Optional minimum CPU platform of the reservation to create.       Manage the accelerators of a future reservation.       At most one of these can be specified:        --accelerator=[count=COUNT],[type=TYPE]        Manage the configuration of the type and number of accelerator        cards attached.        count          The number of accelerators to attach to each instance in the          reservation.        type          The specific type (e.g. nvidia-tesla-k80 for nVidia Tesla K80)          of accelerator to attach to instances in the reservation. Use          gcloud compute accelerator-types list to learn about all          available accelerator types.        --clear-accelerator        Remove all accelerators from the future reservation.       Manage the local ssd of a future reservation.       At most one of these can be specified:        --clear-local-ssd        Remove all local ssd information on the future reservation.        --local-ssd=[count=COUNT],[interface=INTERFACE],[size=SIZE]        Manage the size and the interface of local SSD to use. See        https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd for more        information.        interface          The kind of disk interface exposed to the VM for this SSD.          Valid values are scsi and nvme. SCSI is the default and is          supported by more guest operating systems. NVME may provide          higher performance.        size          The size of the local SSD in base-2 GB.        count          The number of local SSD to use per VM. If you don't specify          this argument, then the default value is 1.      Manage the time specific properties for requesting future capacity       --start-time=START_TIME       Start time of the Future Reservation. The start time must be an       RFC3339 valid string formatted by date, time, and timezone or       "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"; where YYYY = year, MM = month, DD = day, HH =       hours, MM = minutes, SS = seconds, and Z = timezone (i.e.       2021-11-20T07:00:00Z).       At most one of these can be specified:        --duration=DURATION        Alternate way of specifying time in the number of seconds to        terminate capacity request relative to the start time of a request.        --end-time=END_TIME        End time of the Future Reservation. The end time must be an RFC3339        valid string formatted by date, time, and timezone or        "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"; where YYYY = year, MM = month, DD = day, HH        = hours, MM = minutes, SS = seconds, and Z = timezone (i.e.        2021-11-20T07:00:00Z).
