    /// Optional: If left unspecified (default), an update-mask is     automatically created using the flags specified in the command and only     those values are updated. For example: --external-uri='&lt;some-uri&gt;'     --event-time='&lt;some-time&gt;' would automatically generate     --update-mask='external_uri,event_time'. Note that as a result, only     external-uri and event-time are updated for the given finding and     everything else remains untouched. If you want to delete     attributes/properties (that are not being changed in the update     command) use an empty update-mask (''). That will delete all the     mutable properties/attributes that aren't specified as flags in the     update command. In the above example it would delete source-properties.     State can be toggled from ACTIVE to INACTIVE and vice-versa but it     cannot be deleted.    At most one of these can be specified:     --folder=FOLDER      The folder ID (e.g., 456) that contains the finding.     --organization=ORGANIZATION      The organization ID (e.g., 123) that contains the finding.     --project=PROJECT      The project ID (e.g., example-project) that contains the finding.
