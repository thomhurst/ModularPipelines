A full list of available projects can be generated by      running gcloud projects list.      * If specifying one of our public images, image-project must be       provided.      * If there are several of the same image-family value in multiple       projects, image-project must be specified to clarify the image to be       used.      * If not specified and either image or image-family is provided, the       current default project is used.      At most one of these can be specified:       --image=IMAGE       An image to apply to the disks being created. When using this option,       the size of the disks must be at least as large as the image size.       Use --size to adjust the size of the disks.         This flag is mutually exclusive with --source-snapshot and       --image-family.       --image-family=IMAGE_FAMILY       The image family for the operating system that the boot disk will be       initialized with. Compute Engine offers multiple Linux distributions,       some of which are available as both regular and Shielded VM images.       When a family is specified instead of an image, the latest       non-deprecated image associated with that family is used. It is best       practice to use --image-family when the latest version of an image is       needed.       --primary-disk=PRIMARY_DISK       Primary disk for asynchronous replication. This flag is required when       creating a secondary disk.       --source-disk=SOURCE_DISK       Source disk used to create the disk(s). It is safe to delete a source       disk after a disk has been created from the source disk. To get a       list of disks in your current project, run gcloud compute disks list.       This flag is mutually exclusive with --image and --source-snapshot.         When using this option, the size of the disks must be at least as       large as the source disk size. Use --size to adjust the size of the       disks.         The source disk must be in the same zone/region as the disk to be       created.       --source-instant-snapshot=SOURCE_INSTANT_SNAPSHOT       Name of the source instant snapshot used to create the disks.       --source-snapshot=SOURCE_SNAPSHOT       Source snapshot used to create the disks. It is safe to delete a       snapshot after a disk has been created from the snapshot. In such       cases, the disks will no longer reference the deleted snapshot. To       get a list of snapshots in your current project, run gcloud compute       snapshots list. A snapshot from an existing disk can be created using       the gcloud compute disks snapshot command. This flag is mutually       exclusive with --image.         When using this option, the size of the disks must be at least as       large as the snapshot size. Use --size to adjust the size of the       disks.      Key resource - The Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) cryptokey that will    be used to protect the disk. The 'Compute Engine Service Agent' service    account must hold permission 'Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter'.    The arguments in this group can be used to specify the attributes of this    resource.       --kms-key=KMS_KEY       ID of the key or fully qualified identifier for the key.         To set the kms-key attribute:       + provide the argument --kms-key on the command line.         This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in       this group are specified.       --kms-keyring=KMS_KEYRING       The KMS keyring of the key.         To set the kms-keyring attribute:       + provide the argument --kms-key on the command line with a fully        specified name;       + provide the argument --kms-keyring on the command line.       --kms-location=KMS_LOCATION       The Google Cloud location for the key.         To set the kms-location attribute:       + provide the argument --kms-key on the command line with a fully        specified name;       + provide the argument --kms-location on the command line;       + provide the argument --region on the command line.       --kms-project=KMS_PROJECT       The Google Cloud project for the key.         To set the kms-project attribute:       + provide the argument --kms-key on the command line with a fully        specified name;       + provide the argument --kms-project on the command line;       + set the property core/project.      At most one of these can be specified:       --primary-disk-region=PRIMARY_DISK_REGION       Region of the primary disk for asynchronous replication. The primary       and secondary disks must not be in the same region. Overrides the       default compute/region property value for this command invocation.       --primary-disk-zone=PRIMARY_DISK_ZONE       Zone of the primary disk for asynchronous replication. The primary       and secondary disks must not be in the same region. Overrides the       default compute/zone property value for this command invocation.      At most one of these can be specified:       --region=REGION       Region of the disks to create. If not specified, you might be       prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the       compute/region property:           $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION         A list of regions can be fetched by running:           $ gcloud compute regions list         To unset the property, run:           $ gcloud config unset compute/region         Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable       CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.       --zone=ZONE       Zone of the disks to create. If not specified and the compute/zone       property isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone       (interactive mode only).         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the       compute/zone property:           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE         A list of zones can be fetched by running:           $ gcloud compute zones list         To unset the property, run:           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable       CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.      At most one of these can be specified:       --source-disk-region=SOURCE_DISK_REGION       Region of the source disk. This argument is not required if the       target disk is in the same region as the source disk. Overrides the       default compute/region property value for this command invocation.       --source-disk-zone=SOURCE_DISK_ZONE       Zone of the source disk. This argument is not required if the target       disk is in the same zone as the source disk. Overrides the default       compute/zone property value for this command invocation.
