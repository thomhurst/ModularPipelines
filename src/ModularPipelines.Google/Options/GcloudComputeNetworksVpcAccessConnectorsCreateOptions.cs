    /// Machine type of VMs underlying the VPC Access connector. Accepted     values are e2-micro, f1-micro, and e2-standard-4. If left unspecified,     the e2-micro machine type is used.    At most one of these can be specified:     Scaling settings of a VPC Access Connector can be specified in terms of    number of Google Compute Engine VM instances underlying the connector    autoscaling group.      --max-instances=MAX_INSTANCES; default=10       Maximum number of instances within an autoscaling group underlying       the connector. Value must be between 3 and 10, inclusive. Must be       higher than the value specified by --min-instances.      --min-instances=MIN_INSTANCES; default=2       Minimum number of instances within an autoscaling group underlying       the connector. Value must be between 2 and 9, inclusive. Must be       lower than the value specified by --max-instances.     Scaling settings of a VPC Access Connector can be specified in terms of    throughput.      --max-throughput=MAX_THROUGHPUT       Maximum throughput of the connector in Mbps. Refers to the expected       throughput when using an e2-micro machine type. Value must be a       multiple of 100 from 300 through 1000. Must be higher than the       value specified by --min-throughput. If both max-throughput and       max-instances are provided, max-instances takes precedence over       max-throughput. The use of max-throughput is discouraged in favor       of max-instances.      --min-throughput=MIN_THROUGHPUT       Minimum throughput of the connector in Mbps. Refers to the expected       throughput when using an e2-micro machine type. Value must be a       multiple of 100 from 200 through 900. Must be lower than the value       specified by --max-throughput. If both min-throughput and       min-instances are provided, min-instances takes precedence over       min-throughput. The use of min-throughput is discouraged in favor       of min-instances.    At most one of these can be specified:     The Serverless VPC Access API can internally manage the creation of a    subnet to house the VPC connector. To create this subnet, the network ID    (--network) and an IP CIDR range (--range) for the subnet must be    provided.      --network=NETWORK; default="default"       Name of the Compute Engine network to which the connector will be       connected. If left unspecified, the default network will be used.      --range=RANGE       CIDR range of internal addresses that are reserved for this       connector. For example, 10.132.0.0/28. Range must be unique and       non-overlapping with existing ranges in the network.     You can specify a subnet in which to place the connector rather than    using an internally managed subnet. If you wish to use this connector to    attach your Serverless application to a Shared VPC, first share a subnet    to the project to which you are deploying your connector. Then, supply    the name of the subnet (--subnet) and the project ID (--subnet-project)    from which the subnet is hosted to connect to this VPC.      --subnet=SUBNET       User-provided subnet to house the connector. This field can be used       in favor of specifying the network and range fields. e.g.       "my-subnet"      --subnet-project=SUBNET_PROJECT       Project ID of the provided subnet. The default is the project of       the connector.
