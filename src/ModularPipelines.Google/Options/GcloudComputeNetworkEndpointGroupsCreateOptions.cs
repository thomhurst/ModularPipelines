If this flag isn't specified for a NEG with endpoint type      gce-vm-ip-port, gce-vm-ip-portmap or non-gcp-private-ip-port, then      every network endpoint in the network endpoint group must have a port      specified. For a global NEG with endpoint type internet-ip-port and      internet-fqdn-port if the default port is not specified, the well-known      port for your backend protocol is used (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).        This flag is not supported for NEGs with endpoint type serverless.        This flag is not supported for NEGs with endpoint type      private-service-connect.

For Private Service Connect NEGs, you can optionally specify --network      and --subnet if --psc-target-service points to a published service. If      --psc-target-service points to the regional service endpoint of a      Google API, do not specify --network or --subnet.

If not specified, network endpoints may belong to any subnetwork in the      region where the network endpoint group is created.        This is only supported for NEGs with endpoint type gce-vm-ip-port,      gce-vm-ip, private-service-connect, or gce-vm-ip-portmap. For Private      Service Connect NEGs, you can optionally specify --network and --subnet      if --psc-target-service points to a published service. If      --psc-target-service points to the regional service endpoint of a      Google API, do not specify --network or --subnet.      The serverless routing configurations are only valid when endpoint type of    the network endpoint group is serverless.      At most one of these can be specified:       Configuration for a Cloud Function network endpoint group. Cloud     Function name must be provided explicitly or in the URL mask.        --cloud-function-name=CLOUD_FUNCTION_NAME        Cloud Function name to add to the Serverless NEG. The function must        be in the same project and the same region as the Serverless        network endpoint groups (NEG).        --cloud-function-url-mask=CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL_MASK        A template to parse function field from a request URL. URL mask        allows for routing to multiple Cloud Functions without having to        create multiple network endpoint groups and backend services.       Configuration for a Cloud Run network endpoint group. Cloud Run service     must be provided explicitly or in the URL mask. Cloud Run tag is     optional, and may be provided explicitly or in the URL mask.        --cloud-run-service=CLOUD_RUN_SERVICE        Cloud Run service name to add to the Serverless network endpoint        groups (NEG). The service must be in the same project and the same        region as the Serverless NEG.        --cloud-run-tag=CLOUD_RUN_TAG        Cloud Run tag represents the "named revision" to provide additional        fine-grained traffic routing configuration.        --cloud-run-url-mask=CLOUD_RUN_URL_MASK        A template to parse service and tag fields from a request URL. URL        mask allows for routing to multiple Run services without having to        create multiple network endpoint groups and backend services.       Configuration for an App Engine network endpoint group. Both App Engine     service and version are optional, and may be provided explicitly or in     the URL mask. The app-engine-app flag is only used for default routing.     The App Engine app must be in the same project as the Serverless network     endpoint groups (NEG).        --[no-]app-engine-app        If set, the default routing is used. Use --app-engine-app to enable        and --no-app-engine-app to disable.        --app-engine-service=APP_ENGINE_SERVICE        Optional serving service to add to the Serverless NEG.        --app-engine-url-mask=APP_ENGINE_URL_MASK        A template to parse service and version fields from a request URL.        URL mask allows for routing to multiple App Engine services without        having to create multiple network endpoint groups and backend        services.        --app-engine-version=APP_ENGINE_VERSION        Optional serving version to add to the Serverless NEG.      At most one of these can be specified:       --global       If set, the network endpoint group is global.       --region=REGION       Region of the network endpoint group to operate on. If not specified,       you might be prompted to select a region (interactive mode only).         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the       compute/region property:           $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION         A list of regions can be fetched by running:           $ gcloud compute regions list         To unset the property, run:           $ gcloud config unset compute/region         Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable       CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.       --zone=ZONE       Zone of the network endpoint group to operate on. If not specified       and the compute/zone property isn't set, you might be prompted to       select a zone (interactive mode only).         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the       compute/zone property:           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE         A list of zones can be fetched by running:           $ gcloud compute zones list         To unset the property, run:           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable       CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.
