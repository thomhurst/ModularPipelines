The address will represent an internal IP reservation from within the     subnet. If --address is specified, it must be within the subnet's IP     range.     May not be specified with --global.    At most one of these can be specified:     --addresses=ADDRESS,[ADDRESS,...]      Ephemeral IP addresses to promote to reserved status. Only addresses      that are being used by resources in the project can be promoted. When      providing this flag, a parallel list of names for the addresses can      be provided. For example,        $ gcloud compute addresses create ADDRESS-1 ADDRESS-2       \         --addresses 162.222.181.197,162.222.181.198       \         --region us-central1      will result in 162.222.181.197 being reserved as 'ADDRESS-1' and      162.222.181.198 as 'ADDRESS-2'. If no names are given,      server-generated names will be assigned to the IP addresses.     --ip-version=IP_VERSION      Version of the IP address to be allocated and reserved. The default      is IPV4.      IP version can only be specified for global addresses that are      generated automatically (i.e., along with the --global flag, given      --addresses is not specified) and if the --network-tier is PREMIUM.      IP_VERSION must be one of: IPV4, IPV6.    At most one of these can be specified:     --global      If set, the addresses are global.     --region=REGION      Region of the addresses to create. Overrides the default      compute/region property value for this command invocation.
