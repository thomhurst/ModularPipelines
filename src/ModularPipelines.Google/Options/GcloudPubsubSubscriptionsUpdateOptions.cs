If the unit is omitted, seconds is assumed.        --min-retry-delay=MIN_RETRY_DELAY        The minimum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given        message. Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 10        seconds. Valid values are strings of the form INTEGER[UNIT], where        UNIT is one of "s", "m", "h", and "d" for seconds, minutes, hours,        and days, respectively.

If not specified, it will be set to the       push-endpoint.       --push-endpoint=PUSH_ENDPOINT       A URL to use as the endpoint for this subscription. This will also       automatically set the subscription type to PUSH.       At most one of these can be specified:        --clear-push-no-wrapper-config        If set, clear the NoWrapper config from the subscription.
