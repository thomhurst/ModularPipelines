Example:       $ gcloud compute tpus queued-resources ssh example-instance \         --zone=us-central1-a --ssh-flag="-vvv" \         --ssh-flag="-L 80:localhost:80"     This flag will replace occurences of %USER% and %TPU% with their     dereferenced values. For example, passing ``80:%TPU%:80`` into the flag     is equivalent to passing 80:162.222.181.197:80 to ssh(1) if the     external IP address of 'example-instance' is 162.222.181.197.     If connecting to the instance's external IP, then %TPU% is replaced     with that, otherwise it is replaced with the internal IP.

    /// <summary>
    /// Zone of the tpu to ssh. If not specified and the compute/zone property     isn't set, you might be prompted to select a zone (interactive mode     only).     To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the     compute/zone property:       $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE     A list of zones can be fetched by running:       $ gcloud compute zones list     To unset the property, run:       $ gcloud config unset compute/zone     Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable     CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.    These arguments are used to run commands using SSH.     --command=COMMAND      Command to run on the Cloud TPU VM.      Runs the command on the target Cloud TPU Queued Resource's nodes and      then exits.      Note: in the case of a TPU Pod, it will only run the command in the      workers specified with the --worker flag (defaults to worker all if      not set).      This flag argument must be specified if any of the other arguments in      this group are specified.     --output-directory=OUTPUT_DIRECTORY      Path to the directory to output the logs of the commands.      The path can be relative or absolute. The directory must already      exist.      If not specified, standard output will be used.      The logs will be written in files named {WORKER_ID}.log. For example:      "2.log".    At most one of these can be specified:     --internal-ip      Connect to TPU VMs using their internal IP addresses rather than      their external IP addresses. Use this to connect from a Google      Compute Engine VM to a TPU VM on the same VPC network, or between two      peered VPC networks.     --tunnel-through-iap      Tunnel the SSH connection through Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy for TCP      forwarding.      This flag must be specified to attempt to connect via IAP tunneling.      If it is not set, and connection to a Cloud TPU VM without external      IP address is attempted from outside the network, then the command      will fail.      To use IAP tunneling, there must be firewall access to the SSH port      for the IAP TCP IP address range for the network the TPU is created      in. See the user guide      (https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/using-tcp-forwarding) for more      details.      To learn more, see the IAP for TCP forwarding documentation      (https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/tcp-forwarding-overview).    At most one of these can be specified:     --ssh-key-expiration=SSH_KEY_EXPIRATION      The time when the ssh key will be valid until, such as      "2017-08-29T18:52:51.142Z." This is only valid if the instance is not      using OS Login. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for information on time      formats.     --ssh-key-expire-after=SSH_KEY_EXPIRE_AFTER      The maximum length of time an SSH key is valid for once created and      installed, e.g. 2m for 2 minutes. See $ gcloud topic datetimes for      information on duration formats.
