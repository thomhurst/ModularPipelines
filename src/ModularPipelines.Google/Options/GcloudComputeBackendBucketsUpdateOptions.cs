CACHE_MODE must be one of:      CACHE_ALL_STATIC       Automatically cache static content, including common image formats,       media (video and audio), web assets (JavaScript and CSS). Requests       and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well as dynamic       content (including HTML), aren't cached.     FORCE_CACHE_ALL       Cache all content, ignoring any "private", "no-store" or "no-cache"       directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may       result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable)       content. You should only enable this on backends that are not       serving private or dynamic content, such as storage buckets.     USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS       Require the origin to set valid caching headers to cache content.       Responses without these headers aren't cached at Google's edge, and       require a full trip to the origin on every request, potentially       impacting performance and increasing load on the origin server.

    /// The amount of time up to which the response to a signed URL request     will be cached in the CDN. After this time period, the Signed URL will     be revalidated before being served. Cloud CDN will internally act as     though all responses from this backend had a Cache-Control: public,     max-age=[TTL] header, regardless of any existing Cache-Control header.     The actual headers served in responses will not be altered.     For example, specifying 12h will cause the responses to signed URL     requests to be cached in the CDN up to 12 hours. See $ gcloud topic     datetimes for information on duration formats.     This flag only affects signed URL requests.    At most one of these can be specified:     --bypass-cache-on-request-headers=BYPASS_CACHE_ON_REQUEST_HEADERS      Bypass the cache when the specified request headers are matched -      e.g. Pragma or Authorization headers. Up to 5 headers can be      specified.      The cache is bypassed for all cdnPolicy.cacheMode settings.      Note that requests that include these headers will always fill from      origin, and may result in a large number of cache misses if the      specified headers are common to many requests.      Values are case-insensitive.      The header name must be a valid HTTP header field token (per RFC      7230).      For the list of restricted headers, see the list of required header      name properties in How custom headers work      (https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/custom-headers#how_custom_headers_work).      A header name must not appear more than once in the list of added      headers.     --no-bypass-cache-on-request-headers      Remove all bypass cache on request headers for the backend bucket.    At most one of these can be specified:     --client-ttl=CLIENT_TTL      Specifies a separate client (for example, browser client) TTL,      separate from the TTL for Cloud CDN's edge caches.      This allows you to set a shorter TTL for browsers/clients, and to      have those clients revalidate content against Cloud CDN on a more      regular basis, without requiring revalidation at the origin.      The value of clientTtl cannot be set to a value greater than that of      maxTtl, but can be equal.      Any cacheable response has its max-age/s-maxage directives adjusted      down to the client TTL value if necessary; an Expires header will be      replaced with a suitable max-age directive.      The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year).      When creating a new backend with CACHE_ALL_STATIC and the field is      unset, or when switching to that mode and the field is unset, a      default value of 3600 is used.      When the cache mode is set to "USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS", you must omit      this field.     --no-client-ttl      (DEPRECATED) Clears client TTL value.      The --no-client-ttl option is deprecated and will be removed in an      upcoming release. If you're currently using this argument, you should      remove it from your workflows.    At most one of these can be specified:     --custom-response-header=CUSTOM_RESPONSE_HEADER      Custom headers that the external Application Load Balancer adds to      proxied responses. For the list of headers, see Creating custom      headers      (https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/custom-headers).      Variables are not case-sensitive.     --no-custom-response-headers      Remove all custom response headers for the backend bucket.    At most one of these can be specified:     --default-ttl=DEFAULT_TTL      Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this origin      for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or      s-maxage).      The default value is 3600s for cache modes that allow a default TTL      to be defined.      The value of defaultTtl cannot be set to a value greater than that of      maxTtl, but can be equal.      When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTtl      overwrites the TTL set in all responses.      A TTL of "0" means Always revalidate.      The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year). Infrequently      accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined      TTL.      When creating a new backend with CACHE_ALL_STATIC or FORCE_CACHE_ALL      and the field is unset, or when updating an existing backend to use      these modes and the field is unset, a default value of 3600 is used.      When the cache mode is set to "USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS", you must omit      this field.     --no-default-ttl      Clears default TTL value.    At most one of these can be specified:     --max-ttl=MAX_TTL      Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by this      origin.      The default value is 86400 for cache modes that support a max TTL.      Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher      than this, or an Expires header more than maxTtl seconds in the      future, are capped at the value of maxTtl, as if it were the value of      an s-maxage Cache-Control directive.      A TTL of "0" means Always revalidate.      The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year). Infrequently      accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined      TTL.      When creating a new backend with CACHE_ALL_STATIC and the field is      unset, or when updating an existing backend to use these modes and      the field is unset, a default value of 86400 is used. When the cache      mode is set to "USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS" or "FORCE_CACHE_ALL", you must      omit this field.     --no-max-ttl      (DEPRECATED) Clears max TTL value.      The --no-max-ttl option is deprecated and will be removed in an      upcoming release. If you're currently using this argument, you should      remove it from your workflows.    At most one of these can be specified:     --[no-]negative-caching      Negative caching allows per-status code cache TTLs to be set, in      order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects.      This can reduce the load on your origin and improve the end-user      experience by reducing response latency.      Negative caching applies to a set of 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx status codes      that are typically useful to cache.      Status codes not listed here cannot have their TTL explicitly set and      aren't cached, in order to avoid cache poisoning attacks.      HTTP success codes (HTTP 2xx) are handled by the values of defaultTtl      and maxTtl.      When the cache mode is set to CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS,      these values apply to responses with the specified response code that      lack any cache-control or expires headers.      When the cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, these values apply to      all responses with the specified response code, and override any      caching headers.      Cloud CDN applies the following default TTLs to these status codes:      ▸ HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m      ▸ HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal       Reasons): 120s      ▸ HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not       Implemented): 60s      These defaults can be overridden in cdnPolicy.negativeCachingPolicy.      Use --negative-caching to enable and --no-negative-caching to      disable.     --no-negative-caching-policies      Remove all negative caching policies for the backend bucket.     --negative-caching-policy=[[CODE=TTL],...]      Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status code.      NegativeCaching must be enabled to config the negativeCachingPolicy.      If you omit the policy and leave negativeCaching enabled, Cloud CDN's      default cache TTLs are used.      Note that when specifying an explicit negative caching policy, make      sure that you specify a cache TTL for all response codes that you      want to cache. Cloud CDN doesn't apply any default negative caching      when a policy exists.      CODE is the HTTP status code to define a TTL against. Only HTTP      status codes 300, 301, 308, 404, 405, 410, 421, 451, and 501 can be      specified as values, and you cannot specify a status code more than      once.      TTL is the time to live (in seconds) for which to cache responses for      the specified CODE. The maximum allowed value is 1800s (30 minutes),      noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the      cache before the defined TTL.    At most one of these can be specified:     --serve-while-stale=SERVE_WHILE_STALE      Serve existing content from the cache (if available) when      revalidating content with the origin; this allows content to be      served more quickly, and also allows content to continue to be served      if the backend is down or reporting errors.      This setting defines the default serve-stale duration for any cached      responses that do not specify a stale-while-revalidate directive.      Stale responses that exceed the TTL configured here will not be      served without first being revalidated with the origin. The default      limit is 86400s (1 day), which will allow stale content to be served      up to this limit beyond the max-age (or s-max-age) of a cached      response.      The maximum allowed value is 604800 (1 week).      Set this to zero (0) to disable serve-while-stale.     --no-serve-while-stale      (DEPRECATED) Clears serve while stale value.      The --no-serve-while-stale option is deprecated and will be removed      in an upcoming release. If you're currently using this argument, you      should remove it from your workflows.
