    /// List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to update. If a label exists, its value      is modified. Otherwise, a new label is created.        Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens      (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must      contain only hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and      numbers.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-labels       Remove all labels. If --update-labels is also specified then       --clear-labels is applied first.         For example, to remove all labels:           $ gcloud eventarc triggers update --clear-labels         To remove all existing labels and create two new labels, foo and baz:           $ gcloud eventarc triggers update --clear-labels \          --update-labels foo=bar,baz=qux       --remove-labels=[KEY,...]       List of label keys to remove. If a label does not exist it is       silently ignored. If --update-labels is also specified then       --update-labels is applied first.      At most one of these can be specified:       --clear-service-account       Clear the IAM service account associated with the trigger.       --service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT       The IAM service account email associated with the trigger.      Flags for updating the destination to which events should be sent.      At most one of these can be specified:       Flags for updating a GKE service destination.        --destination-gke-namespace=DESTINATION_GKE_NAMESPACE        Namespace that the destination GKE service is running in. If not        specified, the default namespace is used.        --destination-gke-service=DESTINATION_GKE_SERVICE        Name of the destination GKE service that receives the events for        the trigger.        At most one of these can be specified:         --clear-destination-gke-path         Clear the relative path on the destination GKE service to which         the events for the trigger should be sent.         --destination-gke-path=DESTINATION_GKE_PATH         Relative path on the destination GKE service to which the events         for the trigger should be sent. Examples: /route, route,         route/subroute.       Flags for updating a Cloud Run fully-managed resource destination.        --destination-run-region=DESTINATION_RUN_REGION        Region in which the destination Cloud Run service can be found. If        not specified, it is assumed that the service is in the same region        as the trigger.        --destination-run-service=DESTINATION_RUN_SERVICE        Name of the Cloud Run fully-managed service that receives the        events for the trigger. The service must be in the same project as        the trigger.        At most one of these can be specified:         --clear-destination-run-path         Clear the relative path on the destination Cloud Run service to         which the events for the trigger should be sent.         --destination-run-path=DESTINATION_RUN_PATH         Relative path on the destination Cloud Run service to which the         events for the trigger should be sent. Examples: /route, route,         route/subroute.       Flags for updating a Cloud Workflows destination.        --destination-workflow=DESTINATION_WORKFLOW        ID of the workflow that receives the events for the trigger. The        workflow must be in the same project as the trigger.        --destination-workflow-location=DESTINATION_WORKFLOW_LOCATION        Location that the destination workflow is running in. If not        specified, it is assumed that the workflow is in the same location        as the trigger.
